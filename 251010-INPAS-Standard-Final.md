Preface

The International Non-Profit Accounting Standard (INPAS) – history, governance and objectives

- P1 The preparation of financial statements is crucial for accountability and decision making and for trust and confidence in non-profit organisations (NPOs). INPAS is specifically for NPOs and addresses the unique characteristics of NPOs and the types of transactions they undertake.

- P2 INPAS is the primary output of the International Financial Reporting for Non-Profit Organisations (IFR4NPO) project. IFR4NPO was established in 2019 to improve the transparency, consistency, comparability, credibility and reliability of NPO financial statements by developing internationally applicable financial reporting guidance for NPOs.

- P3 INPAS has been developed to meet the following three objectives:

- (a) to improve the quality, transparency and credibility of NPO financial reports.

- (b) to support the provision of NPO financial information that is useful for decision making and accountability, balancing the needs of preparers and users.

- (c) to address specific NPO issues, which will promote the comparability of NPO financial reports.

- P4 In fulfilling these objectives, INPAS aims to take account of the needs of a wide range of NPOs. This recognises that NPOs operate in diverse settings and with different levels of financial reporting complexity. INPAS has an initial focus on those NPOs where accrual-based financial reporting is needed to recognise and measure assets and liabilities and a range of more complex transactions and activities.

- P5 The Technical Advisory Group (TAG)1 reviews INPAS and related documents such as interpretations of INPAS specifications. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA),2 approved the first edition of INPAS prior to the creation of the International Non-Profit Reporting Foundation (INPRF).

Role of international standards in INPAS development

- P6 INPAS is a standalone and complete set of financial reporting guidance. NPOs can apply INPAS when preparing their general purpose financial reports without access to or knowledge of other financial reporting frameworks.

- INPAS is based on existing international financial reporting frameworks that promote the use of general purpose financial statements and other financial reporting. INPAS meets the three objectives in P3 by using these financial reporting frameworks and making appropriate changes for NPOs. The three international financial reporting frameworks that have been used in developing INPAS are the third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard (the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard), full IFRS Accounting Standards, and International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS).

- P8 The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is a separate standard developed and maintained by the IASB. The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is intended to be used by those entities

that are often referred to as small and medium-sized entities (SMEs), private entities or non-publicly accountable entities. The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is based on full IFRS Accounting Standards, with modifications to reflect the needs of the users of SMEs’ financial statements and to reflect cost benefit considerations relevant for SMEs.

- The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) develops and maintains full IFRS Accounting Standards. These set out recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for transactions and events that are important in general purpose financial statements. Full IFRS Accounting Standards are developed for entities with public accountability. These entities are defined by the IASB as those entities that have debt or equity traded in a public market or entities that hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders, for example banks.

- P10 IPSAS are developed by the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB). These are for use by public sector entities around the world in the preparation of general purpose financial reports. Certain IPSAS address financial reporting issues of relevance to NPOs that are not currently covered by IFRS or the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, while other IPSAS are adapted from relevant IFRS to the extent necessary for the public sector.

- P11 The foundational framework of INPAS is the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. INPAS incorporates this framework generally without amendment where an NPO-specific reporting solution to an accounting issue is not required or has not been developed, or the financial reporting solution provided by the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is comprehensive and provides appropriate guidance for NPOs. Terminology has been updated and modifications made to ensure alignment across INPAS sections.

- P12 Where the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard does not meet the needs of NPOs, INPAS draws on its own concepts and pervasive principles, full IFRS Accounting Standards, IPSAS and their respective conceptual frameworks to provide sector-specific reporting solutions through modifications to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. Standards that have been developed by jurisdictions to address NPO-specific reporting issues may also be used, particularly where these jurisdictional-level standards have been developed in a manner that is sufficiently consistent with the conceptual frameworks of IFRS Accounting Standards and/or IPSAS.

- P13 There is a formal process3 for determining whether an NPO-specific issue warrants a modification to the text of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The process used in the development of INPAS can be found in Process for developing the International Non-Profit Accounting Standard through changes to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- P14 INPAS does not yet address all NPO-specific financial reporting issues, as the initial focus has been on those issues identified as priorities following the Consultation Paper. INPAS will address the remaining NPO-specific financial reporting issues in subsequent editions.

Role of INPAS in general purpose financial reports

- INPAS applies to the general purpose financial reports and the general purpose financial statements of NPOs. General purpose financial reports comprise the general purpose financial statements alongside management commentary and other narrative reporting. Together these address the objectives of financial reporting.

- P16 The objective of general purpose financial statements is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to a wide range of users who do not have the

authority to demand reports tailored to meet their information needs. In the NPO context, this will include those to whom an NPO provides services and goods, providers of resources, those representing resource providers and the public that depend on the services and goods provided by NPOs. NPOs can present general purpose financial statements separately or within another public document, including general purpose financial reports.

- P17 A1 Non-Profit Organisations describes the broad characteristics of NPOs. These are entities that are not government or public sector entities and that have the primary objective of both providing a benefit to the public and directing surpluses for the benefit of the public.

- P18 NPOs may produce financial reports for users such as donors, tax authorities or other government authorities, who have the authority to require the preparation of reports tailored to meet their specific needs. Financial reports produced solely for these purposes are unlikely to be general purpose financial reports.

- P19 Furthermore, tax laws are specific to each jurisdiction, and the objectives of general purpose financial reports differ from the objectives of reporting for taxation purposes. Thus, financial statements prepared in conformity with INPAS are unlikely to comply fully with all the measurements required by a jurisdiction’s tax laws and regulations. A similar issue may arise with reporting to donors. NPOs may be able to reduce these ‘dual reporting burdens’ by compiling tax or donor reports as reconciliations from those produced in accordance with INPAS and by other means.

Authority of INPAS

- Legislative or regulatory authorities and standard setters in individual jurisdictions will decide which entities are required or permitted to use INPAS. Similarly, donors may require NPOs to use INPAS Practice Guide 1 Harmonised grant reporting, where NPOs may benefit from using INPAS in its entirety. INPAS A1 provides a description of the types of entities that are expected to use INPAS so that the legislative or regulatory authorities, standard setters and NPOs and their auditors can understand the intended scope of applicability of INPAS.

Organisation of INPAS

- P21 INPAS is organised by topic, with topics grouped into themes. INPAS groups topics that relate to income, expenses, assets, liabilities, matters of principle and to the presentation of financial information. Each topic is presented in a separate numbered section. INPAS identifies paragraphs by section number, followed by paragraph number. Paragraph numbers are in the form xx, yy, where xx is the section number and yy is the sequential paragraph number within that section.

- P22 This authoritative guidance sets the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements that NPOs must follow to comply with INPAS. All the paragraphs in the authoritative guidance have equal authority (except as specified in paragraph A2.2).

- P23 This edition of INPAS also includes authoritative Application Guidance for sections that have not been subject to full review for the NPO context, but where there are consequential amendments arising from other INPAS sections.

- P24 Additional support for preparers applying INPAS is provided in non-authoritative Implementation Guidance (including illustrative examples) and a Basis for Conclusions that accompany INPAS. The Basis for Conclusions provides further detail on the technical and practical considerations taken into account during the development of INPAS. Non
authoritative guidance is not mandatory to comply with INPAS. The Implementation Guidance and the Basis for Conclusions are separate to INPAS.

- P25 In examples that include monetary amounts, the measuring unit is Currency Units (abbreviated as CU).

Maintenance of INPAS

- P26 INPAS will be kept up to date following its initial publication for future amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, as well as relevant new and amended IFRS Accounting Standards, IPSAS and jurisdictional-level standards. Any proposed amendments to INPAS will be published for stakeholder comments through Exposure Drafts, generally, not more than once every three years. This approach is intended to provide a stable and familiar framework for preparers and users.

- P27 Any changes made to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, full IFRS Accounting Standards, IPSAS and jurisdictional-level standards will not apply to INPAS. NPOs shall not anticipate or apply changes made to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, IFRS Accounting Standards, IPSAS or jurisdictional-level standards. Such developments will be considered for future editions of INPAS to determine whether changes for subsequent editions are required.

- If there is an absence of guidance on a specific issue in INPAS, NPOs shall use the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard by analogy. NPOs may also use guidance and principles from IFRS Accounting Standards and its conceptual framework. If this does not address the issue, IPSAS and its conceptual framework can then be used. If none of these sources provides specific guidance, NPO-specific jurisdictional-level standards can be considered. Guidance from these sources can be used provided those principles do not conflict with the requirements in the hierarchy of sources used to make accounting policy decisions in paragraphs B7.4–B7.6.

Group A –

Principles

A1 – Non-Profit Organisations

Intended scope of INPAS

- INPAS is intended for use by entities that do not distribute any surpluses that they may generate to private individuals. Since there is no universal international financial reporting definition of a Non-Profit Organisation (NPO) in law or regulation, a broad characteristics approach has been used to identify the entities that are intended to be within the scope of INPAS. This Section outlines the broad characteristics of NPOs, but ultimately the decision on which entities are required or permitted to use INPAS rests with the judgement of relevant authorities in individual jurisdictions.

Description of non-profit organisations

- For the purposes of INPAS, NPOs are entities that publish general purpose financial reports for external users and have both of the following broad characteristics:

- (a) their primary objective is to provide a benefit to the public; and

- (b) their surpluses are directed for the benefit of the public.

Primary objective of providing a benefit to the public

- A1.3 An NPO has the primary objective of providing a benefit to the public through the services and goods it delivers or the activities that it carries out.

- A1.4 In this context, ‘the public’ refers to the individuals and groups that directly or indirectly benefit from the NPO’s services and activities.

- The scope of benefit to the public may be broad, involving the provision of services and/or goods to members of the general public or members of particular communities, or for wider societal benefit. It follows that the focus of an NPO may be narrow, targeting a specific or defined group.

- This broad definition allows a wide range of entities to potentially be described as an NPO, including those that may be referred to differently by jurisdictions, such as charities, non-government organisations, social advocacy groups, co-operatives, mutual benefit organisations, professional associations and foundations among other organisational forms.

- A1.7 An NPO is not expected to provide private benefits, such as economic or financial returns, to holders of equity or similar ownership claims. Any such benefits, if they occur, should be incidental to the NPO’s primary objective of providing a benefit to the public.

Direct surpluses for the benefit of the public

- An NPO will direct surpluses for the benefit of the public. This includes, but is not limited to, reinvesting in programs, expanding services or strengthening the financial stability of the NPO to enhance future public benefits. An NPO may generate surpluses from activities such as selling services and/or goods, receiving donations or earning returns from financial assets. Surpluses refer to entity-wide surpluses, rather than those generated from individual projects or grants. Generally, surpluses shall not be distributed for private benefit.

Distributions

- A1.9 Generally, an NPO does not make distributions to holders of equity claims in the same way that for-profit organisations do, whether in the form of:

- (a) economic benefits or service potential; or

- (b) residual net assets upon dissolution.

- A1.10 It is recognised that such distributions may be legally permitted but where they do exist, they must be incidental relative to the overall scale of the NPO’s operations. This includes an assessment of their proportionality in relation to the NPO’s net assets, total incoming resources and overall activities. Such distributions shall not compromise the entity’s ability to achieve its primary objective of providing a benefit to the public.

- A1.11 Organisations that have a primary objective of distributing surpluses for private benefit to groups and individuals, such as investors and holders of equity claims, are likely to be for- profit entities.

Membership organisations

- A1.12 An NPO can be a membership organisation, provided it offers a significant public benefit. This benefit must be either to society as a whole or to a specific section of society, contributing to broader societal interests beyond those of their members. Entities that serve the public and societal good are distinct from those that focus on providing economic or financial returns to their members.

- A1.13 Membership organisations where members receive direct and proportional economic or financial returns based on fees or ownership are not an NPO. However, membership organisations that serve public benefit and societal interests, such as co-operatives providing food at cost to support local communities to improve health outcomes, and whose benefits are not directly tied to financial contributions, may be an NPO under INPAS.

Indicators

- A1.14 Where it is not clear whether an entity is an NPO using the criteria in A1.2, the following indicators shall additionally be used to determine whether an entity meets the broad characteristics of an NPO:

- (a) the existence of rights held by individuals (or entities) to financial returns from surpluses generated by the entity – the absence of such rights is an indicator that the entity is an NPO;

- (b) a requirement that residual net assets be transferred upon dissolution to an entity with a similar public benefit purpose – the existence of such rights is an indicator that the entity is an NPO;

- (c) the receipt of, or provision of, voluntary funding – the existence of such transactions is an indicator that the entity is an NPO; and

- (d) assets being held and used for the benefit of the public – the existence of such assets is an indicator that the entity is an NPO.

Government or public sector entities

- A1.15 Government and public sector entities typically meet all of the following criteria: they are responsible for delivering services that benefit the public and/or for redistributing income and wealth; they mainly fund their activities directly or indirectly by means of taxes, government

transfers, social contributions, debt and/or fees; and they do not have a primary objective of making profits. The International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) are specifically designed to apply to these types of entities.

Use of INPAS by entities that have public accountability

A1.16 An entity is defined in full IFRS Accounting Standards as having public accountability if:

- (a) its debt or equity instruments are traded in a public market, or it is in the process of issuing such instruments for trading in a public market (for example, a domestic or foreign stock exchange or an over-the-counter market, including local and regional markets); or

- (b) it holds assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders as one of its primary businesses (for example, most banks, credit unions, insurance companies, securities brokers/dealers, mutual funds and investment banks often meet this second criterion).

- Some entities may also hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders because they hold and manage financial resources entrusted to them by clients, customers or members not involved in the management of the entity. However, if they do so for reasons incidental to a primary business (as for example may be the case for travel or real estate agents, schools, charitable organisations, co-operative enterprises requiring a nominal membership deposit, and sellers that receive payment in advance of delivery of the goods or services such as utility companies), that does not make them publicly accountable.

- A1.18 Some entities that have public accountability may find INPAS useful for accounting issues specific to NPOs. However, the simplifications in INPAS may not meet full requirements of IFRS.

- If a publicly accountable entity as defined in IFRS Accounting Standards applies INPAS, its financial statements should disclose this as part of the disclosures required by B1.20–B1.24. The entity should include an explanation as to why the use of INPAS meets the needs of users of its financial statements, even if law or regulation in that entity’s jurisdiction permits or requires this Standard to be used by publicly accountable entities.

- A1.20 An NPO whose parent uses full IFRS Accounting Standards, or that is part of a consolidated group that uses full IFRS Accounting Standards, may use INPAS in its own financial statements if that NPO by itself does not have public accountability without the need to include the explanation required by A1.19.

- A parent entity (including the ultimate parent or any intermediate parent) assesses its eligibility to use INPAS in its separate financial statements on the basis of its own status without considering whether other group entities have, or the group as a whole has, public accountability. If a parent entity by itself does not have public accountability, it may present its separate financial statements in accordance with INPAS without the explanation required in A1.19 (see G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements), even if it presents its consolidated financial statements in accordance with full IFRS Accounting Standards or another set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as its national accounting standards. Any financial statements prepared in accordance with INPAS shall be clearly distinguished from financial statements prepared in accordance with other requirements.

A2 – Concepts and pervasive principles

Scope of this Section

- A2.1 This Section describes the objective of general purpose financial reports of non-profit organisations (NPOs). It also sets out the concepts and basic principles underlying the general purpose financial reports of an NPO.

- A2.2 The concepts and principles in this Section might not always align with the requirements in other sections of the Standard. In those cases, the requirements in the other sections take precedence over the concepts and principles in this Section.

The objective of non-profit organisations’ general purpose

Objective, usefulness and limitations of general purpose financial reports

- A2.3 The objective of general purpose financial reports of an NPO is to provide financial and non- financial information about the reporting NPO that is useful to existing and potential users of their financial reports for accountability and decision making.

- A2.4 General purpose financial reports include financial and non-financial information that complements and enhances the information provided in the financial statements. Non- financial information will include the information specified by the requirements in A3 Narrative reporting.

- General purpose financial reports do not and cannot provide all the information that existing and potential users need when making decisions. These users of an NPO’s general purpose financial report also consider pertinent information from other sources – for example, general economic conditions and expectations, political events, the political climate, and sector and individual NPO-focused outlooks.

Users of general purpose financial reports

- A2.6 An NPO is responsible for the stewardship of the resources entrusted to it. An NPO is accountable for the management and use of resources to existing and potential resource providers and to the public that benefit from the services and goods provided by the NPO or the activities that it carries out.

- A2.7 For the purposes of INPAS the primary users of an NPO’s general purpose financial reports are existing and potential:

- (a) resource providers – see paragraph A2.8;

- (b) the public that benefit from the services and goods provided by an NPO – see paragraph A2.9; and

- (c) those acting as representatives of the interests of resource providers and the public that benefit from the services and goods provided by an NPO – see paragraph A2.10.

- A2.8 An NPO is provided with resources from numerous sources including, for example, donors and other funders, governments, banks, lenders and creditors. These resource providers will be primary users when they do not have rights to demand information tailored to meet their particular information needs.

- A2.9 The public are those that benefit directly or indirectly from the services and goods provided by the NPO or the activities that it carries out. They may be referred to as service users or recipients or clients, and can range from an entire population – either within a jurisdiction or wider – to a small subset of a community.

- A2.10 The legislative body of a country, state or region (or similar) or members of parliaments or assemblies (or similar bodies) in a state or region will be primary users when acting in the interests of resource providers and the public that benefit from the services and goods provided by an NPO or from the activities that it carries out. This will include individual elected representatives and public officials who have a duty to represent the interests of members of the public who are provided with services and goods by the NPO or benefit from its activities, or who provide it with financial and other resources.

- A2.11 General purpose financial reports are not developed specifically to respond to any individual user’s information needs.

- A2.12 When users exercise their rights to demand information tailored to meet their particular information needs, they are not considered to be primary users of general purpose financial reports. For example, some donors or other funders will have the authority to request special purpose financial reports as part of funding arrangements. Similar considerations may apply to regulators. Information tailored to a user’s individual needs would not be included in general purpose financial reports. However, donors and other funders will be primary users when they are not requesting such information.

Information needs of users for accountability and decision making

- A2.13 The discharge of accountability obligations requires the provision of information about the NPO’s management of its resources in meeting its purposes, its capacity to continue to operate in future periods, and its compliance with any regulations that govern its operations.

- A2.14 Information provided in general purpose financial reports for accountability purposes will also contribute to and inform economic and other decision making.

Information provided by general purpose financial reports to meet the needs of users

- Financial information that is presented in the financial statements on an NPO’s financial position, its contribution to the surplus or deficit and cash flows will need to be enhanced by other financial and non-financial information in general purpose financial reports. The information in general purpose financial reports complements and supplements the financial information presented in the financial statements to fully describe an NPO’s performance.

- A2.16 General purpose financial reports include financial statements that provide information about an NPO’s financial position, specifically about the NPO’s economic resources and the claims against the NPO. Financial statements also provide information about the effects of transactions and other events that change the NPO’s economic resources and claims. Users use this information to make decisions and form expectations based on their assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of the NPO’s future cash flows.

- A2.17 Financial statements also show how efficiently and effectively the reporting NPO’s management has met its responsibility to use its economic resources. This information helps users assess management’s stewardship of those resources.

Qualitative characteristics of information in general purpose financial reports

- A2.18 An NPO uses the qualitative characteristics of useful financial and non-financial information described in paragraphs A2.19–A2.34 to identify the types of information likely to be most useful for users when making decisions about the NPO.

- A2.19 Financial and non-financial information is useful only if it is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent. The usefulness of financial and non-financial information is enhanced if it is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.

Fundamental qualitative characteristics

- A2.20 The fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial and non-financial information are relevance and faithful representation.

Relevance

- A2.21 Financial and non-financial information is relevant if it can influence users’ decisions. Information might be relevant even if some users choose not to make use of it or are already aware of it from other sources.

- A2.22 Financial and non-financial information can affect users’ decisions by having predictive value, confirmatory value or both.

Materiality

- A2.23 Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those financial reports, which provide financial and non-financial information about a specific reporting NPO. Materiality is an NPO-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates in the context of an individual NPO’s financial reports. Consequently, it is not possible to specify a uniform quantitative threshold for materiality or predetermine what could be material in a particular situation.

Faithful representation

- A2.24 Financial reports represent economic or other phenomena in words and numbers. Useful financial and non-financial information not only represents relevant phenomena, but also faithfully represents the substance of the phenomena that it purports to represent. In many circumstances, the substance of an economic or other phenomenon and its legal form are the same. If they are not the same, information about the legal form would not, by itself, faithfully represent the economic or other phenomenon.

- A2.25 To be a perfectly faithful representation, a depiction of an economic or other phenomenon would have three characteristics: completeness, neutrality and freedom from error. Perfection is rarely, if ever, achievable. Instead, the objective of INPAS is to maximise those qualities to the extent possible.

- A2.26 To be complete, a depiction of an economic or other phenomenon includes all information necessary for a user to understand the phenomenon, including all necessary descriptions and explanations.

- To be neutral, a depiction of an economic or other phenomenon is without bias in the selection or presentation of financial or non-financial information. Neutrality is supported by prudence, which is the exercise of caution when an NPO makes judgements under conditions of uncertainty. The exercise of prudence means that assets and income are not overstated, and liabilities and expenses are not understated. Equally, prudence does not allow for the understatement of assets or income or the overstatement of liabilities or expenses. Such misstatements can lead to the overstatement or understatement of income or expenses in future periods. Consequently, some sections of this Standard might contain asymmetric requirements if necessary to help an NPO select the most relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent.

- A2.28 Faithful representation does not mean the depiction of an economic or other phenomenon is accurate in all respects. To be free from error, a depiction of the phenomenon contains no errors or omissions, and an NPO has selected and applied, without errors, a process to produce the information in the financial statements.

Applying the fundamental qualitative characteristics

- The most efficient and effective process by which an NPO applies the fundamental qualitative characteristics of financial and non-financial information, subject to the effects of enhancing characteristics (see paragraph A2.30) and the cost constraint (see paragraphs A2.35–A2.37), is usually:

- (a) first, to identify an economic or other phenomenon, about which information can be useful to users.

- (b) second, to identify the type of information about the phenomenon in (a) that would be most relevant.

- (c) third, to assess whether the relevant information in (b) is available and whether it can provide a faithful representation of the economic or other phenomenon. If so, the process of satisfying the fundamental qualitative characteristics ends at that point. If not, the NPO repeats the process with the next most relevant type of information. In some cases, the NPO might have to prioritise one or more of the fundamental qualitative characteristics over others to meet the objective of general purpose financial reports (see paragraph A2.42).

Enhancing qualitative characteristics

- Comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability are qualitative characteristics that enhance the usefulness of relevant information that provides a faithful representation of what it purports to represent. These enhancing qualitative characteristics might also help an NPO decide how it depicts an economic or other phenomenon if the NPO judges that more than one way provides equally relevant information and an equally faithful representation of that phenomenon.

Comparability

- A2.31 Information about an NPO is more useful if users can compare that information with similar information about other NPOs and with similar information about the same NPO for another period or another date. Comparability is the qualitative characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences between, items. Comparability is reduced if an NPO is permitted to use alternative accounting methods for the same phenomenon.

Verifiability

- A2.32 Verifiability helps assure users that information faithfully represents the phenomenon it purports to represent. Verifiability means that knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is faithful. Quantified information does not have to be a single point estimate to be verifiable; a range of possible amounts and the related probabilities can also be verified.

Timeliness

- A2.33 Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time for it to be able to influence their decisions. Generally, the older the information, the less useful it is. However, some information might continue to be timely long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users will use it to identify and analyse trends.

Understandability

- Classifying, characterising and presenting information clearly and concisely makes it understandable. However, understandability should not be used as a justification for omitting material information. Financial reports would be incomplete if an NPO excluded information about phenomena because the phenomena are inherently complex and cannot be made easy to understand.

The cost constraint on useful financial reporting

- A2.35 Cost is a pervasive constraint on the information that an NPO can provide. Reporting financial and non-financial information imposes costs on an NPO, so it is important that those costs are justified by the benefits of reporting that information.

- A2.36 An NPO expends most of the effort involved in collecting, processing, verifying and disseminating financial and non-financial information, but users or those that benefit from an NPO’s activities ultimately bear those costs. Users also incur costs of analysing and interpreting the information an NPO provides. If the NPO does not provide needed information, users incur additional costs to obtain that information elsewhere or to estimate it.

- Reporting relevant financial and non-financial information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent helps users to make decisions confidently. An individual user also benefits by making more informed decisions. However, it is not possible for general purpose financial reports to provide all the information that every user might find relevant.

Undue cost or effort

- A2.38 Some requirements in this Standard are accompanied by an undue cost or effort exemption. Such exemptions do not apply to other requirements in this Standard.

- A2.39 Whether an NPO must spend undue cost or effort to obtain or judge the information necessary to comply with a requirement depends on the NPO’s specific circumstances and on management’s judgement of the costs and benefits of applying that requirement. To make this judgement, an NPO considers how users’ decision-making could be affected by not having that information. An NPO would spend undue cost or effort applying a requirement if the incremental cost (for example, valuers’ fees) or additional effort (for example, endeavours by employees) substantially exceeds the benefits users would receive from having the information.

- A2.40 An NPO judges whether a requirement would involve undue cost or effort on initial recognition in the financial statements – for example, at the date of the transaction – based on information about the costs and benefits of the requirement at the time of initial recognition. If the undue cost or effort exemption also applies after initial recognition – for example, to a subsequent measurement of an item – the NPO makes a new judgement of undue cost or effort at that subsequent date, based on information available at that date.

- A2.41 If an NPO applies an undue cost or effort exemption, the NPO shall disclose that fact and the reasons why applying the requirement would involve undue cost or effort. This requirement does not apply to the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph G4.17, which is covered by the disclosure requirements in paragraph G4.40.

General purpose financial reports and the reporting NPO

Objective and scope of general purpose financial reports

- The objective of general purpose financial reports is to provide financial information about the reporting NPO’s assets, liabilities, net assets, income and expenses, as well as non-financial information, that is useful to users for accountability and decision-making purposes, including assessing management’s stewardship of the NPO’s resources (see paragraphs A2.3–A2.17).

Reporting period

- A2.43 An NPO prepares its financial reports for a specified reporting period and discloses information about:

- (a) its assets and liabilities, including unrecognised assets and liabilities, net assets and restricted and unrestricted funds within net assets, that existed at the end of the reporting period or during the reporting period; and

- (b) its income and expenses for the reporting period.

- A2.44 To help users identify and analyse changes and trends, an NPO also discloses in its financial reports comparative information for at least one preceding reporting period, except if this Standard permits or requires otherwise.

- A2.45 An NPO also discloses in its financial reports information about possible future transactions and events if the information:

- (a) relates to the NPO’s assets or liabilities, including unrecognised assets or liabilities, or to net assets and funds within net assets, that existed at the end of the reporting period or during the reporting period, or to income or expenses for the reporting period; and

- (b) is useful to users of financial reports.

Perspective adopted in financial reports

- A2.46 An NPO discloses in its financial reports information about transactions and other events from the perspective of the NPO as a whole, not that of any particular group of the NPO’s current or potential users.

- A2.47 An NPO normally prepares its financial statements on the assumption that it is a going concern and will continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Users assume that the NPO has neither the intention nor the need to enter liquidation or to stop trading. If the NPO has

such an intention or need, it might prepare the financial statements on another basis. If so, the NPO describes in its financial statements the basis it has used (see paragraphs B1.4–B1.5).

The reporting NPO

- A2.48 A reporting NPO is an NPO that is required or chooses to prepare general purpose financial reports. A reporting NPO is not necessarily a legal entity. A reporting NPO can be a single NPO or a portion of an NPO or can comprise more than one NPO. It may operate through trusts or other entities, and/or it may have a separate legal identity, autonomy to operate or otherwise support the provision of services and goods.

- A2.49 A reporting NPO will prepare general purpose financial reports as if it were one economic entity or other complete set of activities related to its purposes.

- A2.50 An NPO may have an interest in another entity and be characterised as a controlling NPO (parent), while the other entity (that may or may not be an NPO) is characterised as a controlled entity. Control is the power of an NPO to direct the activities of or use the funds of another entity (see paragraphs G1.8–G1.23).

- A2.51 If a reporting NPO comprises both the controlling NPO and its controlled entities, the reporting NPO’s financial statements are referred to as consolidated financial statements. If the controlling NPO produces financial statements alone, these are referred to as separate financial statements. If the reporting NPO comprises two or more entities that are not linked by a controlling NPO-controlled entity relationship, the reporting NPO’s financial statements are referred to as combined financial statements.

- A2.52 Determining the appropriate reporting boundary of a reporting NPO can be complex when the potential reporting NPO is not a legal entity or when it does not include legal entities that are governed by controlling NPO-controlled entity relationships.

- A2.53 When a reporting NPO is not easily determined, establishing the boundary of the reporting NPO is based on users’ information needs. Users need relevant information that faithfully represents what it purports to represent. Faithful representation requires that:

- (a) the boundary of the reporting NPO does not contain an arbitrary or incomplete set of economic activities;

- (b) including that set of economic activities within the boundary of the reporting NPO results in neutral information; and

- (c) a description is provided of how the boundary of the reporting NPO was determined and of what constitutes the reporting NPO.

- A2.54 Where a reporting NPO is not easily determined, an NPO shall disclose in the notes to the financial statements the basis for the reporting NPO boundary, any significant judgements in determining it and its relationship with other entities.

The elements of financial statements

Introduction

- The elements of financial statements defined in this Section are as follows:

- (a) assets, liabilities and net assets, which relate to a reporting NPO’s Statement of Financial Position.

- (b) income and expenses, which relate to a reporting NPO’s Statement of Income and Expenses if they contribute to surplus and deficit, and to the Statement of Changes in Net Assets if they do not contribute to surplus and deficit.

- A2.56 These elements are linked to the economic resources (see paragraph A2.59), claims and changes in economic resources and claims discussed in paragraphs A2.16–A2.17.

- A2.57 In addition to these elements, further important aspects of NPO financial statements are discussed in this Section. These include:

(a) equity claims; and

- (b) restricted funds and unrestricted funds.

Definition of an asset

- A2.58 An asset is a present economic resource controlled by the NPO as a result of past events.

- An economic resource is a right that has the potential to produce economic benefits or to provide services and goods in accordance with the NPO’s objectives. Economic benefits relate to cash inflows or a reduction in cash outflows. The capacity to provide services and goods that contribute to achieving the NPO’s objectives is service potential. Service potential enables an NPO to achieve its objectives without necessarily generating net cash inflows. It does not have to be certain, or even likely, that the right will produce economic benefits for the potential to exist; it is only necessary that the right exists.

- A2.60 Rights that have the potential to produce economic benefits or service potential take many forms, including;

- (a) rights that correspond to an obligation of another party, for example:

- (i) rights to receive cash.

- (ii) rights to receive services or goods or assign services or goods to third parties.

- (iii) rights to exchange economic resources with another party on favourable terms. Such rights include, for example, a forward contract to buy an economic resource on terms that are currently favourable or an option to buy an economic resource.

- (iv) rights to benefit from an obligation of another party to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event occurs.

- (b) rights that do not correspond to an obligation of another party, for example, rights over physical assets, such as property, plant and equipment or inventories, or rights over some intangible assets.

- A2.61 Many rights are established by contract, legislation or similar means. For example, an NPO might obtain rights from owning or leasing an object, from owning a debt instrument or an equity claim, or from owning a registered patent. However, an NPO might also obtain rights in other ways, for example:

- (a) by acquiring or creating know-how not in the public domain; or

- through another party’s obligation that arises because that other party has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with its customary practices, published policies or specific statements.

- An NPO controls an economic resource if it has the present ability to direct the use of the economic resource and obtain the economic benefits or service potential that might flow from it. An NPO has the present ability to direct the use of an economic resource if it has the right to deploy that economic resource in its activities, or to allow another party to

deploy the economic resource in that party’s activities. Control includes the present ability to prevent other parties from directing the use of the economic resource and from obtaining the economic benefits and or using service potential that may flow from it.

Definition of a liability

- A2.63 A liability is an NPO’s present obligation to transfer an economic resource as a result of past events.

- A2.64 A liability exists only if:

- (a) the NPO has an obligation;

- the obligation is to transfer an economic resource; and

- the obligation is a present obligation that exists as a result of past events.

- An NPO has an obligation if it has a duty or responsibility that the NPO has no practical ability to avoid. An obligation is always owed to another party (or parties). It is not necessary for the NPO to know the identity of the party (or parties) to whom the obligation is owed. Many obligations are established by contract, legislation or equivalent means and are legally enforceable by the party (or parties) to whom they are owed. However, obligations can also arise from an NPO’s customary practices, published policies or specific statements if the NPO has no practical ability to act in a manner inconsistent with those practices, policies or statements. The obligation that arises in such situations is sometimes referred to as a constructive obligation.

- A2.66 A liability gives rise to an obligation to transfer an economic resource if the obligation has the potential to require an NPO to transfer the economic resource to another party (or parties). It does not have to be certain, or even likely, that the NPO will be required to transfer the economic resource for that potential to exist. It is only necessary that the obligation exists and that, in at least one circumstance, it would require the NPO to transfer the economic resource.

- A2.67 Obligations to transfer an economic resource include, for example:

- (a) obligations to pay cash;

- (b) obligations to provide services or deliver goods;

- (c) obligations to exchange economic resources with another party on unfavourable terms;

- (d) obligations to transfer an economic resource if a specified uncertain future event occurs; and

- (e) obligations to issue a financial instrument if that financial instrument will oblige the NPO to transfer an economic resource.

- A2.68 Instead of fulfilling an obligation to transfer an economic resource to the party that has a right to receive that resource, an NPO might sometimes decide, for example:

- (a) to settle the obligation by negotiating a release from the obligation;

- (b) to transfer the obligation to a third party; or

- (c) to replace that obligation to transfer an economic resource with another obligation by entering into a new transaction.

- A2.69 A present obligation exists as a result of past events only if an NPO:

- (a) has already obtained economic benefits or service potential or taken an action giving rise to the obligation; and

- (b) will or might have to transfer an economic resource that it would not otherwise have had to transfer.

- A2.70 The economic benefits or service potential obtained could include, for example, services or goods. The action the NPO has taken could include, for example, undertaking a particular activity for the benefit of the public or operating in a particular geographical area. If the NPO has obtained economic benefits or service potential or has taken an action over time, the resulting present obligation may accumulate over that time.

Assets and liabilities

Unit of account

- A2.71 The unit of account is the right or the group of rights, the obligation or the group of obligations, or the group of rights and obligations, to which an NPO applies recognition criteria and measurement concepts.

- An NPO selects a unit of account for an asset or liability when it considers how recognition criteria and measurement concepts will apply to that asset or liability and to the related income and expenses. In some circumstances, it might be appropriate for the NPO to select one unit of account for recognition and another unit of account for measurement. For example, an NPO might sometimes recognise contracts individually, but measure them as part of a portfolio of contracts. For presentation and disclosure, an NPO might aggregate or separate assets, liabilities, income and expenses into their components.

Executory contracts

- A2.73 An executory contract is a contract, or a portion of a contract, that is equally unperformed. Neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations, or both parties have partly fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent.

- A2.74 An executory contract establishes a combined right and obligation to exchange economic resources. The right and obligation constitute a single asset or liability. The NPO has an asset if the terms of the exchange are currently favourable; it has a liability if the terms of the exchange are currently unfavourable. Whether the NPO includes such an asset or liability in its financial statements depends on both the recognition criteria and the measurement basis the NPO selected for the asset or liability, including, if applicable, any test for whether the contract is onerous.

- A2.75 Net assets are the residual of recognised assets minus recognised liabilities. Net assets will include specific categories of items whose use may be either with restrictions or without restrictions as per paragraph A2.82.

- A2.76 Some of the net assets of an NPO may not be available to it to achieve its objective of providing a benefit to the public but instead are a financial interest that is due to the holders of equity claims. Equity claims are the financial interests in the net assets of an NPO that are due to holders of those claims. Where the holders of equity claims have established a financial interest in some of the net assets of the NPO (see paragraphs A2.77–A2.81), the equity claims shall be recognised as a subset of net assets.

Equity claims in an NPO context

- A2.77 Equity claims in the NPO context are expected to be rare. An NPO’s net assets are anticipated to be used to achieve its objectives, not for distribution. Where equity claims do exist, they are unlikely to be material by magnitude but may be material by nature.

- A2.78 Where equity claims do exist, they provide a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO through an entitlement to:

- (a) distributions of future economic benefits or service potential by the NPO during its life, such distributions being at the discretion of the NPO; and

- (b) distributions of any excess assets over liabilities in the event of the NPO’s dissolution where this excess has not otherwise been distributed to another NPO or entity with a similar purpose.

In some cases, this financial interest may be sold, exchanged, transferred or redeemed. Such a financial interest is similar but not the same as the concept of ownership in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, where investors in equity instruments that provide entitlement to the residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities are deemed to be owners.

- Contributions from holders of equity claims are inflows of resources to the NPO, contributed by parties external to the NPO, as a consequence of equity claim arrangements, that establish or increase a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO. Examples would include the purchase by external parties of share capital issued by the NPO or funds contributed by members that entitle them to a share of net assets.

- A2.80 The provision of funding by an external party that provides governance rights but does not establish a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO is not a contribution from holders of equity claims and does not lead to the recognition of equity claims. Also, if the amount contributed is required to be refunded in the future it will be recognised as a liability in accordance with F2 Liabilities and equity claims.

- Distributions to holders of equity claims are outflows of resources from the NPO, distributed to parties external to the NPO in accordance with equity claim arrangements, that return or reduce a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO. Examples would include the repurchase from external parties of shares issued by the NPO or paying funds back to members so that they no longer had a further entitlement to a share of net assets.

Fund accounting

- A2.82 When assets and liabilities, and corresponding income and expenses, are recognised, they shall be accounted for in an appropriate fund. An NPO may have more than one fund for a variety of reasons. Where this is the case, each fund shall be categorised by an NPO as either a restricted fund or an unrestricted fund. This allows an NPO to manage and present the elements by individual fund. B8 Fund accounting provides more detail on fund accounting.

- A2.83 Some NPOs will hold donated funds in net assets that they are required to hold permanently and cannot be used directly as a resource to fund their activities (such donated funds are often described as endowment funds). Only income which can be generated from the capital may be used by the NPO. These funds are originally recognised as income in an NPO’s financial statements.

Definitions of income and expenses

- A2.84 Income is increases in assets, or decreases in liabilities, that result in increases in net assets, other than those relating to contributions from holders of equity claims.

- A2.85 Expenses are decreases in assets, or increases in liabilities, that result in decreases in net assets, other than those relating to distributions to holders of equity claims.

- A2.86 Income and expenses are the elements of financial statements that relate to an NPO’s financial activity in a reporting period. Users need information about both an NPO’s financial position and its financial activity. Although income and expenses are defined in terms of changes in assets and liabilities, information about income and expenses is just as important as information about assets and liabilities.

- A2.87 Transactions and other events generate income and expenses with varied characteristics. Separating information about income and expenses that have differing characteristics can help users understand the NPO’s financial activity.

Recognition and derecognition

The recognition process

- A2.88 Recognition is the process of capturing assets, liabilities, net assets, income and expenses in the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. Recognition involves depicting the item, either alone or in aggregation with other items, in words and by a single monetary amount in one of those statements and including that amount in one or more totals in that statement. The carrying amount is the amount at which an NPO recognises an asset, a liability or net assets in the Statement of Financial Position.

- A2.89 Recognition links the elements – the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Income and Expenses and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets – as follows (see Figure A2.1 and Figure A2.2). In the Statement of Financial Position, at the beginning and end of the reporting period, total assets minus total liabilities is equal to net assets. Recognised changes in net assets during the reporting period comprise:

- (a) income minus expenses that contribute to surplus and deficit and that are recognised in the Statement of Income and Expenses; plus

- (b) income minus expenses that do not contribute to surplus and deficit and that are recognised directly in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets; plus

- (c) contributions from holders of equity claims minus distributions to holders of equity claims.

Recognition criteria

- A2.90 Only items that meet the definition of an asset, a liability or net assets are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. Similarly, only items that meet the definition of income or expenses are recognised in the Statement of Income and Expenses or in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets, depending on whether they contribute to surplus and deficit or not. However, not all items that meet the definition of one of those elements are recognised (see also paragraph A2.92 below).

- A2.91 An NPO cannot correct its failure to recognise an item that satisfies the recognition criteria by disclosing the accounting policies it used or by providing notes or explanatory material.

Relevance

- A2.92 Information about assets, liabilities, net assets, income and expenses is relevant to users. However, recognition of a particular asset or liability and any resulting income, expenses or changes in net assets might not always provide relevant information. For example, if it is uncertain whether an asset or liability exists, or if an asset or liability exists but the probability of an inflow or outflow of economic benefits or service potential is low, information about that asset or liability might not be relevant. However, that information could be relevant in combination with other factors.

Existence uncertainty

- A2.93 In some cases, it may be unclear whether an asset or liability exists. That uncertainty, which might coincide with a low probability of inflows or outflows of economic benefits or service potential and an exceptionally wide range of possible outcomes, might mean that recognising a single asset or liability would not provide relevant information. Whether or not an NPO has recognised the asset or liability, the NPO might need to provide explanatory information in the financial statements about the associated uncertainties.

Faithful representation

- Recognition of a particular asset or liability is appropriate if it provides not only relevant information but also a faithful representation of that asset or liability and of any resulting income, expenses or changes in net assets. Whether an NPO can provide a faithful representation might be affected by the level of measurement uncertainty associated with the asset or liability or by other factors.

Measurement uncertainty

- A2.95 An NPO measures an asset or liability in order to recognise it. In many cases, an NPO estimates this measurement, and it is therefore subject to measurement uncertainty. Using estimates is an essential part of preparing financial information and does not undermine the usefulness of the information if an NPO clearly and accurately describes and explains the estimates.

- A2.96 An item that fails to meet the recognition criteria might later qualify for recognition as a result of circumstances or events.

- A2.97 Whether or not an NPO recognises an asset or liability, the NPO might need to include explanatory information to provide a faithful representation of the asset or liability. The NPO could include information about the uncertainties associated with the asset or liability’s existence or measurement, or with its outcome – the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic benefits that will ultimately result from the asset or liability (see paragraphs A2.130–A2.131).

Derecognition

- Derecognition is the removal of all or part of a recognised asset or liability from an NPO’s Statement of Financial Position. Derecognition normally occurs if that item no longer meets the definition of an asset or liability. For example:

- (a) for an asset, derecognition normally occurs if the NPO loses control of all or part of the recognised asset; and

- (b) for a liability, derecognition normally occurs if the NPO no longer has a present obligation for all or part of the recognised liability.

- Accounting requirements for derecognition in this Standard aim for an NPO to faithfully represent both any asset and liabilities it retained after the transaction or other event that led to derecognition and the change in the NPO’s assets or liabilities as a result of that transaction or other event.

- A2.100 To achieve the aim described in paragraph A2.99, an NPO normally:

- (a) derecognises any of its assets or liabilities that have expired or have been consumed, collected, fulfilled or transferred, and recognises any resulting income and expenses; and

- (b) continues to recognise any of its retained assets or liabilities.

- To achieve the aim described in paragraph A2.99, an NPO can:

- (a) present the retained component separately in the Statement of Financial Position;

- (b) present separately in the Statement of Income and Expenses any income and expenses that contribute to surplus and deficit recognised as a result of the derecognition of the transferred component;

- (c) present separately in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets any income and expenses that do not contribute to surplus and deficit recognised as a result of the derecognition of the transferred component; or

- (d) provide explanatory information.

Measurement

- A2.102 An NPO quantifies elements recognised in financial statements in monetary terms. To quantify an element, an NPO first selects a measurement basis.

- A2.103 A measurement basis is an identified feature – for example, historical cost, fair value or fulfilment value – of an item being measured. Applying a measurement basis to an asset or liability creates a measure for that asset or liability and for related income and expenses.

- A2.104 The appropriate measurement basis is specific to the item being measured.

Measurement bases

Historical cost

- A2.105 Historical cost measures provide monetary information about the assets, liabilities and related income and expenses using information an NPO derived, at least in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to them.

- A2.106 The historical cost of an asset is the value of the costs incurred in acquiring or creating the asset, comprising the consideration an NPO paid to acquire or create the asset plus

transaction costs. The historical cost of a liability is the value of the consideration the NPO received to incur or take on the liability minus transaction costs.

- A2.107 An NPO updates over time the historical cost of an asset to depict, if applicable:

- (a) the consumption of part or all of the economic resource that constitutes the asset (depreciation or amortisation);

- (b) any payments received for part or all of the asset;

- (c) the effect of events that cause part or all of the historical cost of the asset to no longer be recoverable (impairment); and

- (d) accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the asset.

- A2.108 An NPO updates over time the historical cost of a liability to depict, if applicable:

- (a) the fulfilment of part or all of the liability – for example, by making payments that diminish part or all of the liability or by satisfying an obligation to deliver services or goods.

- (b) the effect of events that increase the value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability to the extent that the liability becomes onerous. A liability is onerous if the historical cost is no longer enough to depict the obligation to fulfil the liability.

- (c) the accrual of interest to reflect any financing component of the liability.

- A2.109 One way an NPO applies a historical cost measurement basis to financial assets and financial liabilities is to measure them at amortised cost. The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability reflects estimates of future cash flows discounted at the rate the NPO determined at initial recognition. For variable rate instruments, the NPO updates the discount rate to reflect changes in the variable rate. Over time, the NPO updates the amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability to depict changes such as the accrual of interest, the impairment of a financial asset and receipts or payments.

Current value

- A2.110 Measurements based on current value provide monetary information about assets, liabilities and related income and expenses using information updated to reflect conditions at the measurement date. Current value measurement bases include:

- (a) fair value;

- (b) current cost;

- (c) value in use for assets; and

- (d) fulfilment value for liabilities.

- A2.111 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Because fair value is not derived, even in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to the asset or the liability, fair value is not increased by transaction costs an NPO incurs when acquiring the asset and is not decreased by the transaction costs an NPO incurs when it takes on the liability.

- A2.112 Current cost is the cost of an equivalent asset at the measurement date, comprising the consideration an NPO would pay at the measurement date plus the transaction costs the NPO would incur at that date. The current cost of a liability is the consideration an NPO would receive for an equivalent liability at the measurement date minus the transaction costs the NPO would incur at that date.

- A2.113 Value in use is the present value of the cash flows or other economic benefits or service potential that an NPO expects to derive from the use of an asset and from its ultimate disposal. Fulfilment value is the present value of the cash or other economic resources that an NPO expects to be obliged to transfer when it fulfils a liability. Because value in use and fulfilment value are usually based on future cash flows, they do not include transaction costs incurred when an NPO acquires an asset or takes on a liability.

Information provided by particular measurement bases

- A2.114 When an NPO selects a measurement basis, it considers the nature of the information that the measurement basis will produce in the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

Historical cost

- If an NPO measures an asset or liability at historical cost, the resulting information might be relevant to users because historical cost uses information derived, at least in part, from the price of the transaction or other event that gave rise to the asset or liability. Because an NPO reduces historical cost to reflect consumption of an asset and its impairment, the amount expected to be recovered from an asset measured at historical cost is at least as great as its carrying amount. Similarly, because an NPO increases the historical cost of a liability when the liability becomes onerous, the value of the obligation to transfer the economic resources needed to fulfil the liability is no more than the carrying amount of the liability.

Current value

- A2.116 If an NPO measures an asset or liability at fair value, the resulting information might have predictive value because fair value reflects market participants’ current expectations about the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows.

- A2.117 If an NPO measures an asset using value in use, the resulting information is about the present value of the estimated cash flows or service potential from the use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal. This information might have predictive value because it can be used in assessing the prospects for future net cash inflows or service potential generated by an asset.

- A2.118 If an NPO measures a liability using fulfilment value, the resulting information is about the present value of the estimated cash flows needed to fulfil the liability. This information might have predictive value, particularly if the NPO expects to fulfil the liability instead of transferring it or settling it by negotiation.

- A2.119 If an NPO provides updated estimates of value in use or fulfilment value, combined with information about estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows, that information might help verify previous estimates of value in use or fulfilment value.

- If an NPO measures an asset or liability using current cost, the resulting information might be relevant because current cost reflects the cost at which an equivalent asset could be acquired or created at the measurement date or the consideration that would be received from incurring or taking on an equivalent liability.

Factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis

- A2.121 When an NPO selects a measurement basis for an asset or liability and for the related income and expenses, the NPO considers the nature of the information that the measurement basis will produce in the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

- A2.122 In most cases, an NPO will not select a measurement basis based on a single factor. The relative importance of each factor will depend on the facts and circumstances of the item being measured.

- A2.123 An NPO selects a measurement basis that will provide useful information to users. To be useful, the information is relevant and faithfully represents what it purports to represent. In addition, the information should be comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable, to the extent possible.

Relevance

- A2.124 The relevance of information an NPO provides using a measurement basis is affected by:

- (a) the characteristics of the asset or liability, in particular whether it is held for its service potential rather than to generate cash flows, the variability of cash flows, and whether the value of the asset or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks; and (b) how that asset or liability contributes to future cash flows or service potential.

- A2.125 If the value of an asset or liability is sensitive to market factors or other risks, or if the asset is held for its service potential, its historical cost might differ significantly from its current value. Consequently, historical cost may not provide relevant information if information about changes in value is important to users.

- A2.126 For assets and liabilities that produce cash flows directly, such as assets that can be sold independently and without a substantial economic penalty (for example, without substantial disruption to an NPO’s activities), the measurement basis that provides the most relevant information is likely to be a current value that takes into account current estimates of the amount, timing and uncertainty of the future cash flows. For assets and liabilities that do not produce cash flows directly, such as assets held for their service potential, an NPO considers the principles of relevance and faithful representation to the extent that they apply to the facts and circumstances.

- A2.127 If an NPO’s activity involves managing financial assets and financial liabilities with the objective of collecting contractual cash flows, amortised cost may provide relevant information that can be used to derive the margin between the interest earned on the assets and the interest incurred on the liabilities.

Faithful representation

- In some circumstances, an NPO uses the same measurement basis for related assets and liabilities to provide users with more useful information than the information that would result from using different measurement bases, for example, if the NPO’s cash flows from one asset or liability are directly linked to its cash flows from another asset or liability.

- A2.129 As noted in paragraph A2.28, although a perfectly faithful representation is free from error, measures do not have to be perfectly accurate.

- A2.130 Measurement uncertainty arises if an NPO estimates an item’s value because it cannot measure the item by observing prices in an active market. The level of measurement uncertainty associated with a particular measurement basis might affect whether the information an NPO provides using that measurement basis is a faithful representation of the NPO’s financial position and income and expenses. A high level of measurement uncertainty does not necessarily prevent an NPO from using a measurement basis that provides relevant information, but in some cases, the level is so high that such information might not lead to a

sufficiently faithful representation. In these cases, an NPO should consider selecting another measurement basis that would also result in relevant information.

- A2.131 Measurement uncertainty is not the same as outcome uncertainty and existence uncertainty. Outcome uncertainty arises when there is uncertainty about the amount or timing of any inflow or outflow of economic benefits or service potential that will result from an asset or liability. Existence uncertainty arises when an asset or a liability’s existence is uncertain. Paragraphs A2.92–A2.93 discuss how existence uncertainty might affect an NPO’s decisions to recognise an asset or liability when the NPO is uncertain about whether that asset or liability exists.

Enhancing qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint

- The enhancing qualitative characteristics of comparability, understandability and verifiability, and the cost constraint, have implications for an NPO’s selection of a measurement basis. The enhancing qualitative characteristic of timeliness has no specific implications for measurement.

- A2.133 Consistently using the same measurement bases for the same items, either from period to period within a reporting NPO or in a single period across NPOs, can help make financial reports more comparable.

- If an NPO changes the measurement basis it uses, its financial reports might be less understandable. However, a change might be justified if, for example, the change results in more relevant information. If an NPO changes the measurement basis it uses, users might need explanatory information to understand the effect of that change.

- A2.135 Understandability depends partly on how many different measurement bases an NPO uses and whether its use of those bases changes over time. In general, the more measurement bases an NPO uses, the more complex the resulting information. Consequently, the information becomes less understandable, and the totals or subtotals in the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets become less informative. However, it could be appropriate for an NPO to use more measurement bases if doing so provides useful information.

- A2.136 Verifiability is improved when an NPO uses measurement bases that result in information that can be independently corroborated, either directly (for example, by observing prices) or indirectly (for example, by checking inputs to a model). If a measure cannot be verified, an NPO might provide explanatory information to enable users to understand how the NPO determined the measure.

Measurement of net assets

- A2.137 Net assets equal the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised assets less the total of the carrying amounts of all recognised liabilities.

- A2.138 In the rare circumstances where an NPO has equity claims, it may be appropriate to directly measure the carrying amount of some individual classes and/or components of net assets.

Presentation and disclosure

Presentation and disclosure as communication tools

- A2.139 A reporting NPO communicates information about its assets, liabilities, net assets and funds with and without restrictions in net assets, income and expenses by presenting and disclosing information in its financial reports.

- A2.140 An NPO that effectively presents and discloses information in its financial reports makes that information more relevant, understandable and comparable. Effective presentation and disclosure also contribute to faithful representation of the NPO’s assets, liabilities, net assets, income and expenses.

- A2.141 Decisions on the selection, location and organisation of information are made in response to the information needs of users. User information needs should underpin:

- (a) information selection for the financial reports, in particular information about the financial position, income and expenses and cash flows of an NPO;

- (b) the location of information in the financial reports, which may affect the way that users interpret information; and

- (c) organisation of information, including decisions on the use of cross-referencing, tables, graphs, headings, numbering and the arrangement of items within a particular component of a report, including decisions on item order.

- Just as cost constrains other financial reporting decisions, it also constrains decisions about presentation and disclosure. When an NPO decides how to present and disclose information, it is important that the NPO considers whether the benefits to users justify the costs of providing and using that information.

Classification

- A2.143 Classification is the sorting of assets, liabilities, net assets, income or expenses on the basis of shared characteristics for presentation and disclosure purposes. Such characteristics include the nature of the item, its role (or function) within the activities conducted by the NPO and how the NPO measures it.

- A2.144 Classifying dissimilar assets, liabilities, net assets, income or expenses together can obscure relevant information, reduce understandability and comparability, and might not result in a faithful representation of what the information purports to represent.

- A2.145 An NPO applies the classification to the unit of account the NPO selected for an asset or liability. However, an NPO separates an asset or liability’s components by characteristic and classifies those components separately if the resulting financial information is more useful.

- A2.146 An NPO classifies income and expenses and includes them in either:

- (a) the Statement of Income and Expenses if they contribute to surplus and deficit; or

- (b) the Statement of Changes in Net Assets if they do not contribute to surplus and deficit.

- A2.147 The Statement of Income and Expenses is the primary source of information about an NPO’s financial activity for the reporting period. All income and expenses are, in principle, included in that statement if they contribute to surplus and deficit. An NPO presents income or expenses in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets when explicitly permitted or required by this Standard. This results in the Statement of Income and Expenses providing more relevant

information or providing a more faithful representation of the NPO’s financial activity for that period.

- A2.148 Individual sections of this Standard might describe situations where income and expenses resulting from the changes in the current value of assets and liabilities are included in the Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

Offsetting

- A2.149 Offsetting occurs when an NPO recognises and measures both an asset and a liability as separate units of account but groups them into a single net amount in the Statement of Financial Position. Offsetting classifies dissimilar items together and therefore is generally not appropriate unless required or permitted by a specific Section of this Standard.

Classification of components net assets

- A2.150 To provide useful information, it may be necessary, where relevant for an NPO, to classify components of net assets separately if those components have different characteristics or are subject to particular legal, regulatory or other requirements.

- A2.151 Similarly, to provide useful information, where an NPO manages net assets in separate funds, classifying net assets between restricted funds and unrestricted funds and providing an explanation of the nature and purpose of the restricted funds will provide useful information.

Aggregation

- A2.152 Aggregation is the adding together of assets, liabilities, net assets, income or expenses that have shared characteristics and are included in the same classification.

- A2.153 Aggregation can make information more useful by summarising a large volume of detail, but in doing so, aggregation conceals some of that detail. An NPO balances its use of aggregation so that relevant information is not obscured either by too little or too much detail.

A3 – Narrative reporting

Scope of this Section

- A3.1 This Section sets out narrative reporting requirements for an NPO. Narrative reporting information enables users to assess the performance of the NPO and provide context to the information included in the financial statements. It provides guidance on the narrative reporting information that is to be presented by an NPO in the same general purpose financial report as its financial statements. The narrative report is published along with the general purpose financial statements to form the general purpose financial report but is not a part of the general purpose financial statements.

- A3.2 This Section sets out the minimum narrative reporting requirements for an NPO applying INPAS. It includes the principles for all narrative information and the minimum requirements for the categories of information to be covered.

- A3.3 When an NPO is able to go beyond these minimum requirements and presents additional information, it may do so provided that the minimum requirements have been met. The principles and high-level requirements of the section permit a flexible approach. An NPO shall report in a manner that best meets the needs of its primary users.

- When an NPO is required to comply with jurisdictional legislative or equivalent narrative reporting requirements, these disclosures should be combined with those specified by this Section to avoid duplication, where possible and where this does not obscure material information.

Principles

- A3.5 An NPO shall present narrative reporting information that is useful for accountability and decision-making. An NPO needs to assess the narrative reporting information that would be of use to its primary users. An NPO shall use this assessment to inform the selection, and the type of information reported and the format of its presentation.

- An NPO may have sensitive information. Sensitive information can include commercial, operational or personal information that is confidential. Information that might be sensitive shall be aggregated where possible so that it is no longer sensitive. An NPO shall aggregate information to summarise more detailed information.

- A3.7 The narrative reporting information presented shall be for the same reporting NPO and reporting period as the financial statements.

- A3.8 An NPO’s narrative reporting information shall be balanced. Information is balanced if it is not skewed, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise presented to make it more likely that primary users will receive that information favourably or unfavourably.

- A3.9 When selecting narrative reporting information in a general purpose financial report, an NPO shall apply the qualitative characteristics and the cost constraint on useful information identified in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles. The narrative report shall provide information that is:

- (a) a faithful representation of the NPO’s operations and activities;

- (b) relevant and capable of making a difference in the decisions made by users, for example, it is material;

- (c) comparable between reporting periods;

- (d) verifiable;

- (e) timely; and

- (f) understandable by the users of the general purpose financial reports.

This will result in narrative reporting information that is useful to users of the NPO’s general purpose financial report.

- A3.10 An item in the narrative report is material if its exclusion or misstatement would affect the decisions and assessments made by users of the general purpose financial report. As such, materiality depends not just on size but also on the nature of the information provided.

Information to be included in the narrative report

- A3.11 An NPO shall present:

- (a) information on its performance objectives and what it has done during the reporting period in working towards those performance objectives; and

- (b) commentary discussing and analysing its financial statements.

- A3.12 An NPO shall provide narrative reporting information related to the following categories:

- (a) an overview of the NPO;

- (b) performance reporting;

- (c) financial objectives and strategies;

- (d) analysis of the NPO’s financial statements; and

- (e) principal risks and uncertainties.

An overview of the NPO

- A3.13 An NPO shall provide an overview to present contextual information for the narrative report. The overview shall consider responses to the following questions:

- (a) Who are we? – a description of the legal form of the NPO, how it is structured and what governance arrangements apply to it;

- (b) What do we exist for? – a description of the purpose for which the NPO exists, including any formal mission and vision statements; and

- (c) What do we do? – a description of the NPO’s main activities, including significant relationships the NPO has with other entities.

Performance reporting

- A3.14 An NPO shall present information on:

- (a) the performance objectives of the NPO and what it intended to achieve during the reporting period; and

- (b) what it has done in working towards those performance objectives including what is has achieved during the reporting period.

- A3.15 The NPO shall provide performance measures and descriptions to demonstrate its performance for the reporting period. The performance measures and descriptions (including, for example, those relating to the meeting of service, project or activity objectives) will depend on the NPO and its performance objectives, but must take into account:

- (a) quantitative measures that provide a numerical measurement by which to assess performance – for example, the quantity of a particular good or service provided by an NPO, or ratings by service users on a scale of 1–10;

- (b) qualitative measures that provide a non-numerical measurement by which to assess performance – for example, whether the goods and services provided by an NPO were in accordance with a particular quality standard, or ratings by service users of high/ medium/low; and

- (c) qualitative descriptions that provide a non-numerical description by which to assess performance – for example, descriptions by individuals supported by the NPO of improvements made to their wellbeing from open-ended questions in interviews.

- An NPO shall exercise judgement to ensure that it provides information that is useful for accountability and decision-making purposes to users of the general purpose financial report. The principles in paragraph A3.9 will guide these judgements.

Financial objectives and strategies

- An NPO shall provide information on its objectives and strategies relating to its financial position, income and expenses, net assets and cash flows. This information shall:

- (a) identify the resources that must be managed by the NPO to achieve its financial objectives and strategies; and

- (b) demonstrate how these financial objectives and strategies support the achievement of the NPO’s performance objectives.

- A3.18 An NPO shall also report significant changes in its financial objectives and strategies from the previous period or periods, as well as the impact this may have on the achievement of its performance objectives.

Analysis of the NPO’s financial statements

- A3.19 An NPO shall include an analysis of significant changes and trends in its financial position, income and expenses, net assets and cash flows. An NPO applies judgement to provide a focus on significant and important financial statement items. The NPO shall not simply reiterate the information presented in the financial statements. Specifically, the analysis shall not repeat the disclosures made in accordance with B6 Notes to the financial statements, but these disclosures may inform the analysis of the financial statements.

- An NPO’s narrative report shall clearly present the financial statement analysis to demonstrate coherence with items in the financial statements. Any adjustments made to information from the financial statements in producing the financial statement analysis shall be disclosed along with the nature and reasons for the adjustment.

- A3.21 As part of this analysis, the NPO shall provide information on the impact of significant changes and trends in its financial position, income and expenses, net assets and cash flows on the achievement of its financial and performance objectives.

Principal risks and uncertainties

- A3.22 An NPO shall provide information on the principal risks and uncertainties that affect the achievement of its performance objectives and its financial position, income and expenses, net assets and cash flows. This shall include:

- (a) an explanation of how these risks and uncertainties relate to the performance objectives and financial objectives and strategies of the NPO;

- (b) an explanation of changes in those risks and uncertainties since the last reporting date; and

- (c) how the NPO manages risks and uncertainties.

Presentation

- A3.23 Narrative information shall be clearly identified. Information provided in the narrative report shall adhere to the principles specified in paragraphs A3.5–A3.10 and be presented in a clear and concise manner.

- A3.24 An NPO shall consider the format of the information that it provides when applying the requirements of this Section.

- A3.25 Cross-referencing from the narrative reporting information to the financial statements will enable users to understand and assess the narrative reporting information within the context of the financial statements.

- A3.26 In addition to cross-referencing from the narrative information to the financial statements within the general purpose financial report, an NPO may also consider it beneficial to cross- reference to information that is held outside of the general purpose financial report. For example, it may be appropriate to provide users with additional detail on performance objectives and to reduce the volume of information provided in the general purpose financial reports.

- A3.27 When an NPO does cross-reference to information held outside of the general purpose financial report, it shall ensure that:

- (a) a complete set of narrative reporting information is provided to users in the general purpose financial report in accordance with this Section – an NPO shall not simply provide references to information held elsewhere; and

- (b) the cross-referenced information held outside of the general purpose financial report is, and will remain, unchanged and available to users of the general purpose financial report.

Comparative information and consistency of reporting

- A3.28 The usefulness of narrative reporting information to users is improved through providing comparative information and through consistent reporting by an NPO.

- A3.29 Comparative information shall be provided by an NPO for the preceding reporting period for amounts and descriptive information reported in the current reporting period. The provision of comparative information shall be consistent with the principles in B1 Presentation and compliance (see paragraph B1.16).

- A3.30 When the information is narrative or descriptive, judgement may be required in determining what and how to disclose comparative information.

- A3.31 Narrative reporting information shall be reported consistently by an NPO. When changes are made to what an NPO reports or how an NPO reports its narrative reporting information, the reasons for and the nature and effect of these changes shall be explained.

- A3.32 When changes are required to narrative reporting information, for example, if an NPO changes its missional purposes or measures performance in a different way, the NPO shall provide the reason for the change and explain its impact on reported information.

- A3.33 If an NPO becomes aware of material prior period errors, whether this is related to numerical or descriptive information, it shall correct these by restating the comparative information for any prior period(s) presented in the general purpose financial reports and disclose an explanation of the error.

- A3.34 A material prior period error occurs when narrative reporting information has either been materially misstated or omitted altogether in a previous general purpose financial report. When an NPO becomes aware that a material prior period error has occurred, the NPO shall correct this in the next general purpose financial report it produces by restating comparative information for any prior periods presented and by disclosing an explanation of the error.

Disclosure

Disclosure of judgements

- A3.35 An NPO will use judgement in the selection and presentation of narrative reporting information that is reported in accordance with this Section. An NPO shall disclose those judgements that are most relevant to users’ understanding of the NPO’s narrative reporting information.

Reporting of other information

- An NPO may choose or be required to present additional information in its general purpose financial report beyond the narrative reporting required in this Section. When it does so, the additional information shall, as far as possible, be presented in compliance with the requirements of this Section (principles, presentation, comparative information, consistency of reporting and disclosure of judgements).

- A3.37 An NPO shall consider reporting other relevant information that goes beyond the categories listed in paragraph A3.12 where this enhances the understanding of the narrative reporting information for the users of the financial report. This could include environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, and/or broader sustainability reporting.

- A3.38 When other information is included in the narrative report in accordance with paragraph A3.36, this shall follow the requirements, as far as possible, of this Section. When providing such other information an NPO shall ensure that it does not obscure the information required by paragraphs A3.11–A3.22.

- A3.39 If an NPO decides it will be useful to provide other information in the narrative report, it should, if possible, be based on standards or guidance that are prescribed elsewhere, or sector established practices and norms such as international standards for sustainability reporting, governance codes or requirements or recognised performance indicators.

- A3.40 When other information is provided, the basis of preparation shall be described. Any standards, practices or other approaches used in the provision of other information shall be disclosed.

- A3.41 The basis of preparation and the standards, practices and other approaches used for the reporting of other information shall be consistently applied. When other information is no longer relevant or useful its use shall be discontinued. When it is discontinued, the reason it is no longer reported shall be disclosed in the narrative report for the reporting periods including comparative periods in which it has been discontinued.

A4 – Fair value measurement

Scope of this Section

- A4.1 This Section applies when another section requires or permits fair value measurements or disclosures about fair value measurements, except leasing transactions within the scope of D6 Leases.

- A4.2 The disclosures required by this Section are not required for:

- (a) plan assets measured at fair value in accordance with D4 Employee benefits; and

- (b) assets for which the recoverable amount is fair value less costs of disposal in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets.

Objective of fair value measurement

- The objective of a fair value measurement is to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction (not a forced transaction) to sell an asset or to transfer a liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, (an exit price at the measurement date).

Measurement principles

- A4.4 Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is a market-based, rather than entity-specific measurement. An NPO shall measure fair value using the same assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The NPO’s intention to hold the asset or settle the liability is not relevant.

- A4.5 An NPO shall take into account the characteristics of the asset or liability when measuring fair value if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Such characteristics include:

- (a) the condition and location of the asset; and

- (b) restrictions, if any, on the sale or use of the asset.

- A4.6 An NPO shall assume that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in either:

- (a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or

- (b) in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.

- The NPO must have access to the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, an NPO shall assume the market in which the NPO would normally enter into a transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability is the principal market or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Even if no observable market exists, the NPO shall assume that a transaction takes place at the measurement date as a basis for estimating fair value.

- A4.8 An NPO shall ignore transaction costs when using the price in the principal (or most advantageous) market to measure the fair value of the asset or liability. Transaction costs are not a characteristic of an asset or a liability; instead, they are specific to a transaction.

- A4.9 If location is a characteristic of the asset, an NPO shall adjust the price in the principal (or most advantageous) market for the costs, if any, that would be incurred to transport the asset from its current location to that market.

Highest and best use for non-financial assets

- A4.10 When making a fair value measurement of a non-financial asset, an NPO shall take into account a market participant’s ability to generate economic benefit or service potential by using the asset for its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset for its highest and best use.

- A4.11 The highest and best use of a non-financial asset takes into account any use of the asset that is physically possible, legally allowed and financially feasible, as follows:

- (a) a use that is physically possible takes into account the physical characteristics of the asset that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset (for example, the location or size of a property);

- (b) a use that is legally allowed takes into account any legal restrictions on the use of the asset that market participants would take into account when pricing the asset (for example, the zoning regulations applicable to a property); and

- (c) a use that is financially feasible takes into account whether a use generates adequate income or cash flows that market participants would require from an investment in that asset put to that use.

asset put to that use.

- A4.12 An NPO shall assume the current use of a non-financial asset is its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.

- A4.13 If a non-financial asset provides maximum value to market participants through its use in combination with other assets (and liabilities), an NPO shall assume the asset would be used with those other assets (and liabilities) and that those other assets (and liabilities) would be available to market participants. An NPO shall make consistent assumptions about the highest and best use of a non-financial asset for all the assets (for which highest and best use is relevant) with which the asset would be used.

Valuation techniques

- If a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, an NPO shall measure fair value using another valuation technique. The NPO shall use a valuation technique that is appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value. The NPO shall maximise its use of relevant observable inputs and minimise its use of unobservable inputs.

- Three widely used valuation approaches are the market approach, the cost approach and the income approach. An NPO shall use a valuation technique consistent with one or more of these approaches:

- (a) the market approach uses as inputs the prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or similar assets, liabilities or a group of assets and liabilities. For example, valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables.

- (b) the cost approach calculates the amount that would be required currently to replace the service capacity of an asset (often called ‘current replacement cost’).

- the income approach converts future amounts (for example, cash flows or income and expenses) to a single current (that is, discounted) amount. Valuation techniques using the income approach include:

(i) present value techniques;

- (ii) option pricing models; and

- (iii) the multi-period excess earnings method, which is used to measure the fair value of some intangible assets.

- An NPO shall account for revisions resulting from a change in the valuation technique or a change in its application as a change in accounting estimates in B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors. However, an NPO is not required to apply the disclosure requirements in B7 for a change in accounting estimate resulting from a change in a valuation technique or its application.

- An asset or a liability measured at fair value might have a bid price and an ask price (for example, an input from a dealer market). If so, an NPO shall measure the fair value of the asset or liability using the price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances. The NPO shall use this price to measure fair value regardless of how the NPO categorises the input within the fair value hierarchy (that is Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3; see paragraphs A4.22–A4.27). The NPO is permitted, but not required, to use the bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for liability positions. This Section does not preclude an NPO from using mid-market pricing or other pricing conventions, within a bid-ask spread, that are used by market participants as a practical expedient for fair value measurements.

Reliable measure of fair value

- A4.18 A valuation technique would be expected to arrive at a reliable measure of fair value if:

- (a) the technique reasonably reflects how the market could be expected to price the asset; and

- (b) the technique’s inputs reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk return factors inherent in the asset.

- A4.19 The fair value of investments in assets that do not have a quoted market price in an active market is reliably measurable if:

- (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value measures is not significant for that asset; or

- (b) the probabilities of the various measures within the range can be reasonably assessed and used to estimate fair value.

- A4.20 The variability in the range of reasonable fair value measures of assets that do not have a quoted market price is likely not to be significant in many situations. Normally an NPO can estimate the fair value of an asset acquired from an outside party. However, if the range of reasonable fair value measures is significant and the probabilities of the various measures cannot be reasonably assessed, then a reliable measure of fair value is not available.

- A4.21 If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available for an asset measured at fair value (or is not available without undue cost or effort when an undue cost or effort exemption is provided – for example, see paragraphs F1.20(c) and F1.57(b)), an NPO shall instead use its carrying amount at the last date the asset was reliably measurable as its new cost. An NPO shall measure the asset at this cost amount less impairment until a reliable measure of fair

value is available (or is available without undue cost or effort when such an exemption is provided).

Fair value hierarchy

- A4.22 For consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, an NPO shall apply a fair value hierarchy, categorising the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels – Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. This fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). In some cases, an NPO might categorise the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these cases, an NPO shall categorise the entire fair value measurement at the level of the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Level 1 inputs

- A4.23 Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the NPO can access at the measurement date. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value. An NPO shall use a quoted price in an active market to measure fair value whenever such a price is available.

- If an NPO holds a position in a single asset or liability (including a position comprising many identical assets or liabilities, such as a holding of financial instruments) and the asset or liability is traded in an active market, the NPO shall measure the fair value of the asset or liability by multiplying the quoted price for the individual asset or liability by the quantity it holds. The fair value measurement of the asset or liability would be categorised within Level 1.

Level 2 inputs

- A4.25 Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs – other than quoted prices included within Level 1 – for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include:

- (a) quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities that are similar to the asset or liability.

- (b) quoted prices in markets that are not active for assets or liabilities that are similar or identical to the asset or liability.

- (c) observable inputs other than quoted prices for the asset or liability, for example:

- (i) interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals;

- (ii) implied volatilities; and

- (iii) credit spreads.

- (d) market-corroborated inputs.

- A4.26 If an NPO adjusts a Level 2 input in a way that is significant to the entire measurement and uses significant unobservable inputs, the NPO might need to categorise the fair value measurement within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Level 3 inputs

- A4.27 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. An NPO shall develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the NPO’s own data. In developing unobservable inputs, an NPO is permitted to begin with its own data, but the NPO shall adjust this data if reasonably available information

indicates that other market participants would use different data or there is something particular to the NPO that is not available to other market participants (for example, an entity- specific synergy). An NPO need not make exhaustive efforts to obtain information about market participant assumptions. However, an NPO shall take into account all information about market participant assumptions that is reasonably available.

Disclosures

- A4.28 An NPO shall disclose for each class of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the Statement of Financial Position after initial recognition:

- (a) the carrying amounts at the end of the reporting period;

- (b) the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety (Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3); and

- (c) a description of the valuation technique(s) the NPO used for fair value measurements categorised within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, and the inputs used in the fair value measurement.

- A4.29 For recurring fair value measurements categorised within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, an NPO shall disclose total gains or losses for the period recognised in:

- (a) surplus or deficit, and the line items in surplus or deficit in which those gains or losses are recognised; and

- (b) the Statement of Changes in Net Assets, and the line items in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets in which those gains or losses are recognised.

- A4.30 An NPO shall determine appropriate classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of:

- (a) the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability; and

- (b) the level of the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised.

- A class of assets and liabilities will often require greater disaggregation than the line items presented in the Statement of Financial Position; however, an NPO shall disclose sufficient information to permit reconciliation to the line items presented in the Statement of Financial Position.

- A4.32 An NPO shall present the quantitative disclosures required by paragraphs A4.28–A4.31 in a table unless another format would be more useful.

Application Guidance A4 – Fair value measurement

Scope

- AA4.1 Fair value determinations for an NPO are substantially like those of other entities. Some of the special considerations for an NPO are included in this Application Guidance.

Applying fair value for an NPO

- AA4.2 An NPO does not have to conduct an exhaustive search of all possible markets to identify the principal (most advantageous) market, but it shall take into account all information that is reasonably available.

- AA4.3 The most advantageous market may not be the one that generates the highest price but is the market that an NPO is realistically able to access at the measurement date.

- Social use assets may be more difficult to value as they may be unusual or heritage in nature, or simply because they do not generate cash flows. Social use assets held for their service potential may mean that their fair value is tied to value to a community.

- AA4.5 For an NPO, the fair value measurement hierarchy shall generally be applied as follows:

- (a) Level 1 open market values are likely to be limited to specific assets.

- (b) Level 2 values that are derived from observable prices may be relevant to the NPO for some assets and liabilities – for example, land and buildings.

- (c) where market values for an asset are available, but an NPO uses the asset for social purposes rather than maximising cash inflows, a Level 3 technique shall be employed. Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy will be used for assets where there are no observable inputs.

- AA4.6 Heritage assets shall be valued using the principles in E2 Property, plant and equipment.

- The fair value of assets held for their service potential shall be determined using the cost approach, where there is no observable market. The cost approach calculates the value based on the current cost required to replace the capacity of an asset to deliver services.

Fair value of donated assets

- AA4.8 The fair value measurement of a donated asset on initial recognition becomes its deemed cost.

- AA4.9 NPO assets and liabilities may require the use of a Level 3 technique; that is either the market approach, cost approach or income approach, where observable inputs are not available. For donated assets, Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy can be applicable depending on the level of observable inputs and the impact of an asset being held for social purpose as set out in AA4.5(c).

- AA4.10 If an observable market price is not available and obtaining a reliable measurement of fair value under paragraph AA4.7 is impracticable, the fair value of donated items shall be determined as their ‘replacement cost’. Replacement cost is the lowest economic cost that would be incurred in achieving the service potential created for use in delivering services to beneficiaries. This provides the value of an equivalent item in local use, or ‘value in use’. An NPO may use the cost to the donor as the deemed fair value where this is known and is relevant.

Fair value of restricted use assets

- AA4.11 Where a restriction is placed on how an asset can be used over time, the fair value of that asset shall be evaluated based on its current usage within those restrictions, if these would be considered by the market participant. An NPO shall consider any differences between the restrictions that would transfer to another buyer or market participant and those that are NPO-specific. The fair value will be the highest and best use of that asset under the NPO’s

circumstances. An NPO shall not determine the highest and best use as if the restriction were lifted.

- AA4.12 The fair value of an asset that is subject to a restriction shall take account of the service potential of that asset in determining its value. This should take account of the capacity needed to support the delivery of services to beneficiaries rather than, for example, the location of the asset subject to a restriction (unless the location is a requirement) or its technical specification, which may exceed the capacity needed by the NPO.

Fair value application in a crisis

- AA4.13 There may be situations where an NPO is operating in a crisis situation and it is not able to determine a fair value for the assets that it is receiving (for example, donated inventory) because to do so would be impracticable in that location or at that time. Paragraphs AE1.5–AE1.7 set out the approach to be used for donated inventory. These same principles apply to other classes of assets.

A5 – Foreign currency translation

Scope of this Section

- An NPO can conduct foreign activities in two ways. It may have transactions in foreign currencies, or it may have foreign operations. In addition, an NPO may present its financial statements in a foreign currency. This Section prescribes how to include foreign currency transactions and foreign operations in the financial statements of an NPO and how to translate financial statements into a presentation currency. Accounting for financial instruments that derive their value from the change in a specified foreign exchange rate (for example, foreign currency forward exchange contracts) and hedge accounting of foreign currency items are dealt with in F1 Part II Other financial instrument issues.

Functional currency

- A5.2 Each NPO shall identify its functional currency. An NPO’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the NPO operates.

- The primary economic environment in which an NPO operates is normally the one in which it primarily generates and expends cash. Consequently, the following are the most important factors an NPO considers in determining its functional currency:

- (a) the currency:

- (i) that mainly influences sales prices for goods and services (this will often be the currency in which sales prices for its goods and services are denominated and settled); and

- (ii) of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales prices of its goods and services.

- (b) the currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of providing services and goods (this will often be the currency in which such costs are denominated and settled).

- (c) the currency that mainly influences the value of grants, donations and similar income and the cost of providing grants, donations and similar expenses (this will often be the currency in which such incomes or costs are denominated and settled).

- A5.4 The following factors may also provide evidence of an NPO’s functional currency:

- (a) the currency in which funds from financing activities (issuing debt and equity instruments or receiving loans) are generated; and

- (b) the currency in which receipts from operating activities are usually retained, including cash balances retained as reserves.

- The following additional factors are considered in determining the functional currency of a foreign operation, and whether its functional currency is the same as that of the reporting NPO (the reporting NPO in this context being the NPO that has the foreign operation as its controlled entity, branch, associate or joint arrangement):

- (a) whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as an extension of the reporting NPO instead of being carried out with a significant degree of autonomy. An example of the former is when the foreign operation only sells goods imported from the reporting NPO and remits the proceeds to it. An example of the latter is when the

operation accumulates cash and other monetary items, incurs expenses, generates income and arranges borrowings, all substantially in its local currency.

- (b) whether transactions with the reporting NPO are a high or a low proportion of the foreign operation’s activities, including funding provided by the NPO to the foreign operation in the form of grants, donations and similar income.

- (c) whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation directly affect the cash flows of the reporting NPO and are readily available for remittance to it.

- (d) whether cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation are sufficient to service existing and normally expected debt obligations or operating expenses without funds being made available by the reporting NPO, either in the form of loans or grants, donations and similar income.

Estimating the spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable (paragraphs AA5.36–AA5.42)

- If, at a measurement date, a currency is not exchangeable into another currency (as described in paragraphs AA5.26–AA5.34), an NPO shall estimate the spot exchange rate at that date. An NPO’s objective in estimating the spot exchange rate is to reflect the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take place at the measurement date between market participants under prevailing economic conditions.

Reporting foreign currency transactions in the functional currency

Initial recognition

- A5.7 A foreign currency transaction is a transaction that is denominated or requires settlement in a foreign currency, including transactions arising when an NPO:

- (a) buys or sells goods or services whose price is denominated in a foreign currency;

- (b) enters into transactions such as grant agreements that are denominated in foreign currency;

- (c) borrows or lends funds when the amounts payable or receivable are denominated in a foreign currency; or

- (d) otherwise acquires or disposes of assets, or incurs or settles liabilities, denominated in a foreign currency.

- A5.8 An NPO shall record a foreign currency transaction, on initial recognition in the functional currency, by applying to the foreign currency amount the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.

- A5.9 The date of a transaction is the date on which the transaction first qualifies for recognition in accordance with this Standard. For practical reasons, a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction is often used, for example, an average rate for a week or a month might be used for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that period. However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate.

- A5.10 When an NPO pays or receives consideration in advance of a grant obligation being fulfilled (either as a grant revenue or a grant expense) in a foreign currency, it recognises a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability. The exchange rate to be used on the initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it) is the exchange rate at the

date on which the NPO initially recognised the non-monetary asset or the non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, the NPO shall determine a date of the transaction for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.

Reporting at the end of the subsequent reporting periods

A5.11 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall:

- translate foreign currency monetary items using the closing rate;

- (b) translate non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction; and

- (c) translate non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

- A5.12 An NPO shall recognise, in surplus or deficit in the period in which they arise, exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous periods, except as described in paragraph A5.16.

- A5.13 Foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary items such as grant receivables, cash received and held in a foreign currency and grant payables shall be presented consistent with the transaction to which the gain or loss relates. For example, if B8 Fund accounting requires that a transaction is presented within restricted funds, then any exchange gain or loss shall also be presented within restricted funds.

- A5.14 When another section of this Standard requires a gain or loss on a non-monetary item to be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets, an NPO shall recognise any exchange component of that gain or loss in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. However, when a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised in surplus or deficit, an NPO shall recognise any exchange component of that gain or loss in surplus or deficit.

Net investment in a foreign operation

- A5.15 An NPO may have a monetary item that is receivable from or payable to a foreign operation. An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, a part of the NPO’s net investment in that foreign operation and is accounted for in accordance with paragraph A5.16. Such monetary items may include long-term receivables or loans. They do not include short-term receivables or payables.

- Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting NPO’s net investment in a foreign operation shall be recognised in surplus or deficit in the separate financial statements of the reporting NPO or the individual financial statements of the foreign operation as appropriate. In the financial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting NPO (for example, consolidated financial statements when the foreign operation is a controlled entity), such exchange differences shall be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and reported as a component of unrestricted funds. They shall not be recognised in surplus or deficit on disposal of the net investment.

Change in functional currency

- A5.17 When there is a change in an NPO’s functional currency, the NPO shall apply the translation procedures applicable to the new functional currency prospectively from the date of the change.

- A5.18 As noted in paragraphs A5.2–A5.5, the functional currency of an NPO reflects the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to the NPO. Accordingly, once the functional currency is determined, it can be changed only if there is a change to those underlying transactions, events and conditions. For example, a change in the currency that mainly influences the sales prices of goods and services may lead to a change in an NPO’s functional currency.

- A5.19 The effect of a change in functional currency is accounted for prospectively. In other words, an NPO translates all items into the new functional currency using the exchange rate at the date of the change. The resulting translated amounts for non-monetary items are treated as their historical cost.

Use of a presentation currency other than the functional currency

Translation to the presentation currency

- A5.20 An NPO may present its financial statements in any currency (or currencies). If the presentation currency differs from the NPO’s functional currency, the NPO shall translate its items of income and expense and financial position into the presentation currency. For example, when a group contains individual entities with different functional currencies, the items of income and expense and financial position of each entity are expressed in a common currency so that consolidated financial statements may be presented.

- A5.21 An NPO whose functional currency is not the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall translate its results and financial position into a different presentation currency using the following procedures:

- (a) assets and liabilities for each Statement of Financial Position presented (that is, including comparatives) shall be translated at the closing rate at the date of that Statement of Financial Position;

- (b) income and expenses for each Statement of Income and Expenses (that is, including comparatives) shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and

- (c) all resulting exchange differences shall be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and reported as part of unrestricted funds unless otherwise specified. They shall not subsequently be reclassified to surplus or deficit.

- For practical reasons, an NPO may use a rate that approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions – for example, an average rate for the period – to translate income and expense items. However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of the average rate for a period is inappropriate.

- A5.23 The exchange differences referred to in paragraph A5.21(c) result from:

- (a) translating income and expenses at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and assets and liabilities at the closing rate; and

- (b) translating the opening net assets at a closing rate that differs from the previous closing rate.

When the exchange differences relate to a foreign operation that is consolidated but not fully controlled, accumulated exchange differences arising from translation and attributable to the non-controlling interest are allocated to, and recognised as part of, non-controlling interest in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

- A5.24 An NPO whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy shall translate its results and financial position into a different presentation currency using the procedures specified in H2 Hyperinflation.

Translation of a foreign operation into the controlling NPO’s presentation currency

- In incorporating the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a foreign operation with those of the reporting NPO, the NPO shall follow normal consolidation procedures, such as the elimination of intragroup balances and intragroup transactions of a controlled entity (see G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements) and the translation procedures set out in paragraphs A5.20–A5.24. However, an intragroup monetary asset (or liability), whether short-term or long-term, cannot be eliminated against the corresponding intragroup liability (or asset) without showing the results of currency fluctuations in the consolidated financial statements. This is because the monetary item represents a commitment to convert one currency into another and exposes the reporting NPO to a gain or loss through currency fluctuations. Accordingly, in the consolidated financial statements, a reporting NPO continues to recognise such an exchange difference in surplus or deficit, or if it arises from the circumstances described in paragraph A5.16, the NPO shall recognise it in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

- Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition of that foreign operation shall be treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation. Thus, they shall be expressed in the functional currency of the foreign operation and shall be translated at the closing rate in accordance with paragraph A5.21.

Disclosures

- A5.27 In paragraphs A5.29 and A5.30, references to ‘functional currency’ apply, in the case of a group, to the functional currency of the controlling NPO.

- A5.28 An NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the amount of exchange differences recognised in surplus or deficit during the period, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through surplus or deficit in accordance with F1 Financial instruments;

- (b) the amount of exchange differences arising during the period and classified in a separate component of net assets at the end of the period.

- A5.29 An NPO shall disclose the currency in which the financial statements are presented. When the presentation currency is different from the functional currency, an NPO shall state that fact and shall disclose the functional currency and the reason for using a different presentation currency.

- A5.30 When there is a change in the functional currency of either the reporting NPO or a significant foreign operation, the NPO shall disclose that fact and the reason for the change in functional currency.

- A5.31 The exchange rate gains and losses that contribute to a deficit or surplus on an individual grant agreement that is required by B8 to be presented within restricted funds shall be disclosed in accordance with the reporting requirements of B8.

- A5.32 When an NPO estimates a spot exchange rate because a currency is not exchangeable into another currency (see paragraph A5.6), the NPO shall disclose:

- (a) the currency and a description of the restrictions that result in that currency not being exchangeable into the other currency;

- (b) a description of affected transactions;

- (c) the carrying amount of affected assets and liabilities;

- the spot exchange rates used and whether those rates are;

- observable exchange rates without adjustment (see paragraphs AA5.37–AA5.41); or

- (ii) spot exchange rates estimated using another estimation technique (see paragraph AA5.42); and

- (e) information about the estimation process, including qualitative and quantitative information about the inputs and assumptions used.

- A5.33 When a foreign operation’s functional currency is not exchangeable into an NPO’s presentation currency or the presentation currency is not exchangeable into a foreign operation’s functional currency, an NPO shall disclose:

- (a) the name of the foreign operation;

- (b) whether the foreign operation is a controlled entity, joint arrangement, associate or branch;

- (c) its principal place of business;

- (d) summarised financial information about the foreign operation; and

- (e) the nature and terms of any contractual arrangements that could require the NPO to provide financial support to the foreign operation, including events or circumstances that could expose the NPO to a loss.

Application Guidance A5 – Foreign currency

Scope

- AA5.1 A5 Foreign currency translation sets out how an NPO accounts for activities carried out in currencies other than its own functional currency and sets out the principles to apply.

Functional currency

- AA5.2 The functional currency is the main currency of the NPO’s activity. There are two ways in which an NPO may have activities in other currencies:

- (a) it may enter into transactions, such as selling or buying goods or services, receiving or paying money, receiving or making grants or donations, borrowing or lending in currencies other than its functional currency; and

- (b) it may have foreign operations such as a foreign branch, controlled entity, associate or joint venture, which mainly carry out their activities in a different principal currency and hence have a different functional currency to the NPO itself.

- AA5.3 An NPO may choose or be required to prepare its financial statements in a currency that differs from its functional currency. The currency in which the financial statements are presented is defined as the presentation currency.

- AA5.4 An NPO shall identify its functional currency when it is established. The NPO shall identify its functional currency through an assessment. It is not an accounting policy choice. Once an NPO has identified its functional currency, an NPO shall only change it if the circumstances considered in the assessment change.

- AA5.5 An NPO shall identify its functional currency by considering the primary economic environment in which it operates, as set out in paragraphs A5.3–A5.4. This is normally the economic environment in which it primarily generates and expends cash. For some NPOs, this may be straightforward, and the functional currency will be the domestic currency of the country of operation of the NPO. For others that have significant foreign currency transactions or foreign operations, the identification may require further analysis.

- AA5.6 The most significant indicators of the economic environment are the currency that influences the prices of an NPO’s sales of goods and services, its purchases of goods and services, its payment of other costs particularly employee costs or other costs of providing services and goods and the value of grants and donations (both received and paid). Usually this will be the currency in which these transactions are denominated and paid. If these factors alone do not clearly identify the functional currency, the NPO shall consider other factors relating to the financing of the NPO. These may include the currency used for borrowings and the currency in which the NPO decides to retain any significant cash surpluses.

- AA5.7 If an NPO receives the majority of its funding in a currency other than its domestic currency, then it shall perform a detailed assessment to identify its functional currency.

- An NPO shall identify the functional currency of its foreign operations such as a controlled entity, branch, associate or joint arrangement using the factors listed in paragraph A5.5. The initial consideration is to decide whether the foreign operation has the same or a separate economic environment to the NPO holding the foreign operation (the controlling NPO).

- AA5.9 The four factors in paragraph A5.5 are means to assess the degree of financial interaction and dependency between the controlling NPO and the foreign operation. If there is little interaction, so that the foreign operation mostly manages its own finances, it is probable that it has a separate economic environment. If there is a significant transfer of cash or funds between the controlling NPO and the foreign operation in the form of investment, remittances, payments or receipts for goods and services, or grants or donations, it is probable that they have the same economic environment.

- AA5.10 Where the functional currency of the foreign operation is separate from that of the controlling NPO, the functional currency shall be assessed using the same approach as for any stand- alone NPO, as set out in paragraphs A5.3–A5.4.

- AA5.11 If the foreign operation does not have a separate economic environment, then the functional currency of the controlling NPO and foreign operation will be the same.

Reporting foreign currency transactions in the functional currency

Monetary items

- AA5.12 An NPO shall translate at each balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items using the closing exchange rate, which is the spot exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Monetary items are rights to be received or obligations to deliver a fixed or determinable number of units of currency. Monetary items are either held in cash or items that will result in a future

inflow or outflow of cash, for example, debtors, grant receivables, creditors, grant payables, loans or borrowings.

- AA5.13 The underlying principle is that exchange differences shall follow the presentation of the transaction to which it relates. Where another section of INPAS, such as B8, requires a transaction to be presented within restricted funds, the exchange rate differences arising from retranslation of monetary items relating to that transaction (such as grant receivables or grant payables) shall be presented consistent with that transaction.

- AA5.14 Where a monetary item such as a foreign currency bank account includes a number of transactions, it might not be possible to separately identify the retranslated balance relating to an individual grant revenue or expense transaction. Where this is the case, an NPO shall allocate the total exchange gain or loss to each grant revenue or expense transaction, with the allocation method being a suitable proxy for the cash balance on an individual grant transaction.

Non-monetary items

- AA5.15 The essential feature of a non-monetary item is the absence of a right to receive (or an obligation to deliver) a fixed or determinable number of units of currency. Examples of non- monetary items are property, plant and equipment or intangible assets measured at historical cost. An NPO shall continue to translate non-monetary items at the exchange rate used at the date of the initial transaction. As a result, no further foreign exchange translation arises on these items after their initial recognition.

- AA5.16 Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value (for example, property, plant and equipment items held at fair value) shall be translated using the exchange rate when the fair value was determined. An NPO will need to re-translate these items at subsequent balance sheet dates.

Monetary and non-monetary items and grant agreements

- AA5.17 Payments made in advance by grantors under a grant agreement that has unfulfilled delivery obligations create liabilities for the grant recipient (delivery obligation liabilities) that are non-monetary items.

- AA5.18 Amounts received in advance by a grant recipient under a grant agreement that has unextinguished fulfilment rights for the grantor (prepayment assets) are also non-monetary items.

- AA5.19 Transactions where there is an absence of a right to receive or an obligation to deliver a fixed or determinable number of units of currency are non-monetary items. However, where there is a further settlement event relating to, for example a delivery obligation liability, such as a refund transaction, this transaction is a monetary item until the amount of revenue to be recognised is settled.

- AA5.20 Where exchange rate differences impact on the amounts of grants or donations received or receivable under a grant agreement the NPO shall consider the substance of the transaction, the nature of the impact of the translation gain and the terms of the grant agreement. If the impact of the change in exchange rates is to require a refund to the grantor or donor, the refund is a separate transaction. This shall create a liability and a new expense. Where there is an outstanding delivery obligation liability, the NPO shall remeasure the delivery obligation liability to reflect the new liability for the refund.

- AA5.21 If an NPO incurs an additional obligation in a grant agreement with a delivery obligation because of the effect of changes in exchange rates it shall consider the nature of this obligation and whether it meets the definition of an onerous grant agreement under D5 Provisions and contingencies. Where this additional obligation and corresponding expense meets the definition of an onerous grant agreement such transactions shall be presented in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements.

Use of a presentation currency other than the functional currency

- AA5.22 INPAS permits NPO financial statements to be presented in any currency. This may be desirable where the functional currency is not the domestic currency of the NPO or if the NPO needs financial statements in a particular currency for a specific purpose – for example, where this has been requested by a donor. Hence, the presentation currency used for a set of financial statements is a choice. Where a presentation currency other than the functional currency is used to present the financial statements, the approach set out in A5.21–A5.24 shall be applied to the financial statements in their entirety. Presentation of a part of the financial statements – for example, just the Statement of Income and Expense in the donor’s currency – is not permissible within the primary financial statements. INPAS Practice Guide 1 Harmonised grant reporting provides separate guidance that allows for the reporting of transactions in a different currency to meet donor reporting requirements.

- AA5.23 A frequent application of the use of a presentation currency is for the translation of the results of a foreign operation with a different functional currency to the controlling NPO. This allows the financial statements to be presented in a common currency, which is usually the functional currency of the controlling NPO.

- AA5.24 Where monetary assets or liabilities are held between the controlling NPO and a foreign operation (for example, a loan or short-term payable from one party to the other), consolidation in a common currency will not eliminate any foreign exchange gain or loss arising in the financial statements of the party holding the foreign currency item. As a result, any foreign exchange gain or loss arising will be reported in the consolidated financial statements, even though the intergroup assets or liabilities themselves are eliminated on consolidation.

- AA5.25 The purpose of the application guidance in paragraphs AA5.26-AA5.35 is to help an NPO determine whether a currency is exchangeable and estimate the spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable (see paragraphs AA5.36–AA5.42).

Step I – Assessing whether a currency is exchangeable

- AA5.26 A currency is exchangeable into another currency when an NPO is able to obtain the other currency within a time frame that allows for a normal administrative delay and through a market or exchange mechanism in which an exchange transaction would create enforceable rights and obligations. An NPO assesses whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency:

- (a) at a measurement date; and

- (b) for a specified purpose.

- AA5.27 If an NPO is able to obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency at the measurement date for the specified purpose, the currency is not exchangeable into the other currency.

- AA5.28 An NPO might determine that a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, even though that other currency might be exchangeable in the other direction. For example, an

NPO might determine that currency PC is not exchangeable into currency LC, even though currency LC is exchangeable into currency PC.

Time frame

- AA5.29 A spot exchange rate is the exchange rate for immediate delivery. However, an exchange transaction might not always complete instantaneously because of legal or regulatory requirements, or for practical reasons such as public holidays. A normal administrative delay in obtaining the other currency does not preclude a currency from being exchangeable into that other currency. What constitutes a normal administrative delay depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the exchange transaction.

Ability to obtain the other currency

- AA5.30 In assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency, an NPO shall consider its ability to obtain the other currency (either directly or indirectly), instead of its intention or decision to do so. For example, subject to the other requirements in paragraphs AA5.26–AA5.35, regardless of whether the NPO intends or decides to obtain currency PC, currency LC is exchangeable into currency PC if the NPO is able either (directly) to exchange LC for PC, or (indirectly) to exchange LC for another currency (FC) and then exchange FC for PC.

Markets or exchange mechanisms

- AA5.31 In assessing whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency, an NPO shall consider only markets or exchange mechanisms in which a transaction to exchange the currency for the other currency would create enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability is a matter of law. Whether an exchange transaction in a market or exchange mechanism would create enforceable rights and obligations depends on the facts and circumstances surrounding the exchange transaction.

Purpose of obtaining the other currency

- AA5.32 Exchange rates might vary depending on how the currency is to be used. For example, the relevant authorities of a jurisdiction might set a preferential exchange rate for imports of specific goods and a ‘penalty’ exchange rate for dividend payments to other jurisdictions.

- AA5.33 Accordingly, whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency could depend on the purpose for which an NPO obtains (or hypothetically might need to obtain) the other currency. In assessing exchangeability, an NPO shall assume its purpose in obtaining the other currency is:

- (a) to realise or settle individual foreign currency transactions, assets or liabilities when the NPO reports foreign currency transactions in its functional currency (see paragraphs A5.7–A5.14 and A5.17–A5.19).

- (b) to realise or settle its net assets or net liabilities when the NPO uses a presentation currency other than its functional currency (see paragraphs A5.20–A5.24). The NPO’s net assets might be realised by, for example, distributions to holders of equity claims.

- (c) to realise or settle its net investment in the foreign operation when the NPO translates the results and financial position of a foreign operation into a presentation currency (see paragraphs A5.25–A5.26). The NPO’s beneficial interest in a foreign operation might be realised by, for example, receipt of distributions from the foreign operation or disposal of its beneficial interest in the foreign operation.

- AA5.34 An NPO shall assess whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency separately for each purpose specified in paragraph AA5.33.

Ability to obtain only limited amounts of the other currency

- AA5.35 A currency is not exchangeable into another currency at the measurement date if, for a purpose specified in paragraph AA5.33, an NPO is able to obtain no more than an insignificant amount of the other currency. For example, an NPO with a functional currency of LC has liabilities denominated in currency FC. The NPO assesses whether the total amount of FC it can obtain for the purpose of settling those liabilities is no more than an insignificant amount compared with the aggregated amount (the sum) of its liability balances denominated in FC.

Step II – Estimating the spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable (paragraph A5.6)

- AA5.36 This Standard does not specify how an NPO estimates the spot exchange rate when a currency is not exchangeable. In estimating the spot exchange rate to meet the objective in paragraph A5.6, an NPO is permitted to use either:

- (a) an observable exchange rate without adjustment (see paragraphs AA5.37–AA5.41); or

- (b) another estimation technique (see paragraph AA5.42).

Using an observable exchange rate without adjustment

- AA5.37 Examples of an unadjusted observable exchange rate include:

- (a) a spot exchange rate for a purpose other than that for which an NPO assesses exchangeability (see paragraphs AA5.38–AA5.39); and

- (b) the first exchange rate at which an NPO is able to obtain the other currency for the specified purpose after exchangeability of the currency is restored (first subsequent exchange rate) (see paragraphs AA5.40–AA5.41).

Using an observable exchange rate for another purpose

- AA5.38 A currency that is not exchangeable into another currency for one purpose might be exchangeable into that currency for another purpose. For example, an NPO might be able to obtain a currency to import specific goods but not to pay dividends. In such situations, the NPO might conclude that an observable exchange rate for another purpose meets the objective described in paragraph A5.6.

- AA5.39 An observable exchange rate for another purpose might not reflect the prevailing economic conditions when, for example:

- (a) it includes an ‘incentive’ or ‘penalty’ set to encourage, or deter, entities from obtaining the other currency for particular purposes;

- (b) an NPO is able to obtain the other currency only for limited purposes (such as to import emergency supplies);

- (c) it is set through regular interventions by the relevant authorities; or

- (d) it is unchanged over time instead of being updated daily (or even more frequently).

Using the first subsequent exchange rate

- AA5.40 A currency that is not exchangeable into another currency at the measurement date for a specified purpose might subsequently become exchangeable into that currency for that purpose. In such situations, an NPO might conclude that the first subsequent exchange rate meets the objective described in paragraph A5.6.

- AA5.41 The first subsequent exchange rate might not reflect the prevailing economic conditions when, for example:

- (a) the date at which exchangeability is restored is long after the measurement date; or

- (b) an economy is subject to hyperinflation or high inflation and prices often change quickly, perhaps several times a day.

Using another estimation technique

- AA5.42 An NPO using another estimation technique is permitted to use any observable exchange rate – including rates from exchange transactions in markets or exchange mechanisms that do not create enforceable rights and obligations – and adjust that rate, as necessary, to meet the objective described in paragraph A5.6.

Disclosure

- AA5.43 Where grantors or donors do not accept exchange rate risk, exchange rate losses will ultimately be funded by the NPO from its unrestricted funds. Where a transfer is required between restricted funds and unrestricted funds as a result of an exchange rate loss on a grant agreement, these movements shall be separately presented in accordance with B8.

B1 – Presentation and compliance

Scope of this Section

- B1.1 This Section explains fair presentation of financial statements and the narrative report in the general purpose financial report, what compliance with INPAS requires and what comprises a complete set of financial statements.

Fair presentation of financial statements

- B1.2 Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, income and expenses, other changes in net assets and cash flows of an NPO. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles:

- (a) the application of INPAS, with additional disclosure when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation of the financial position, income and expenses, other changes in net assets and cash flows of an NPO.

- (b) the application of this Standard by an NPO with public accountability is unlikely to result in a fair presentation in accordance with this Standard (see paragraph A1.18).

The additional disclosures referred to in (a) are necessary when compliance with the specific requirements in this Standard is insufficient to enable users to understand the effect of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the NPO’s financial position and income and expenses.

Accrual basis

- An NPO shall prepare its financial statements, except for cash flow information, using the accrual basis of accounting. On the accrual basis, items are recognised as assets, liabilities, net assets, income or expenses when they satisfy the definitions and recognition criteria for those items.

Going concern

- B1.4 When preparing financial statements, the management of an NPO using this Standard shall assess the NPO’s ability to continue as a going concern. An NPO is a going concern unless management either intends to liquidate it or to cease activities, or it has no realistic alternative but to do so. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least but is not limited to twelve months from the reporting date.

- B1.5 When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions that cast significant doubt upon the NPO’s ability to continue as a going concern, the NPO shall disclose those uncertainties. When an NPO does not prepare financial statements on a going concern basis, it shall disclose that fact, together with the basis on which it prepared the financial statements and the reason why the NPO is not regarded as a going concern.

Complete set of financial statements

- B1.6 A complete set of financial statements of an NPO shall include all the following:

(a) a Statement of Financial Position as at the reporting date;

- (b) a Statement of Income and Expenses for the reporting period, displaying those items of income and expense recognised during the period in determining surplus or deficit;

- (c) a Statement of Changes in Net Assets for the reporting period;

- (d) a Statement of Cash Flows for the reporting period; and

- (e) notes comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

- B1.7 Because paragraph B1.16 requires comparative amounts in respect of the previous period for all amounts presented in the financial statements, a complete set of financial statements means that an NPO shall present, as a minimum, two of each of the required financial statements and related notes.

- B1.8 In a complete set of financial statements, an NPO shall present each financial statement with equal prominence.

- An NPO may use titles for the financial statements other than those used in this Standard, as long as they are not misleading. Similarly, an NPO may choose other labels for the headings and line items used in this Standard provided they are not misleading.

Identification of the financial statements

- B1.10 An NPO shall clearly identify each of the financial statements and the notes and distinguish them from other information in the same document. In addition, an NPO shall display the following information prominently and repeat it when necessary for an understanding of the information presented:

- (a) the name of the reporting NPO and any change in its name since the end of the preceding reporting period;

- (b) whether the financial statements cover the individual NPO or a group of entities;

- (c) the date of the end of the reporting period and the period covered by the financial statements;

- (d) the presentation currency as defined in A5 Foreign currency translation; and

- (e) the level of rounding, if any, used in presenting amounts in the financial statements.

- B1.11 An NPO shall disclose the following in the notes:

- (a) the domicile and legal form of the NPO, its country of incorporation or registration (if applicable) and the address of the office registered with the jurisdictional regulator (or principal place of business if different from the registered office or there is no registered office).

- (b) a description of the nature of the NPO’s operations and its principal activities.

Frequency of reporting

- An NPO shall present a complete set of financial statements (including comparative information – see paragraph B1.16) and a narrative report at least annually. When the end of an NPO’s reporting period changes and the financial statements and narrative report are presented for a period longer or shorter than one year, the NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) that fact;

- (b) the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and

- (c) the fact that comparative amounts presented in the financial statements (including the related notes) and the narrative report are not entirely comparable.

Consistency of presentation

- B1.13 An NPO shall retain the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements and narrative report from one period to the next unless:

- (a) it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the NPO’s operations or a review of its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies in B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors; or

- (b) this Standard requires a change in presentation.

- B1.14 When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements or narrative report is changed, an NPO shall reclassify comparative amounts unless the reclassification is impracticable. When comparative amounts are reclassified, an NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the nature of the reclassification;

- (b) the amount of each item or class of items that is reclassified; and

- (c) the reason for the reclassification.

- B1.15 If it is impracticable to reclassify comparative amounts, an NPO shall disclose why reclassification was not practicable.

Comparative information

- B1.16 Except when this Standard permits or requires otherwise, an NPO shall disclose comparative information in respect of the previous comparable period for all amounts presented in the current period’s financial statements. An NPO shall also include comparative information for narrative and descriptive information when it is relevant to an understanding of the current period’s financial report.

Materiality and aggregation

- B1.17 An NPO shall present separately each material class of similar items. An NPO shall present separately items of a dissimilar nature or function unless they are immaterial.

- B1.18 When applying this Standard, an NPO shall decide, after taking into consideration all the relevant facts and circumstances, how it aggregates information in the financial statements, which include the notes, and the narrative report. An NPO shall not reduce the understandability of its financial statements or the narrative report by obscuring material information with immaterial information or by aggregating material items that have different natures or functions.

- B1.19 Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those financial reports, which provide financial information about a specific reporting NPO. Materiality depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An NPO assesses whether information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its financial report taken as a whole.

Compliance with INPAS

- B1.20 An NPO that has complied with the requirements to produce both the financial statements and the narrative report as part of the general purpose financial report shall make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with INPAS in the notes. An NPO shall not be described as complying with INPAS unless it complies with all the requirements of this Standard. Where an NPO is transitioning to INPAS, it shall comply with the disclosure requirements in Z1 Transition to INPAS.

- B1.21 In the extremely rare circumstances when management concludes that compliance with this Standard would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of NPO general purpose financial reports as set out in A2, the NPO shall depart from that requirement in the manner set out in paragraph B1.22, unless the relevant regulatory framework prohibits such a departure.

- B1.22 When an NPO departs from a requirement of this Standard in accordance with paragraph B1.21, it shall disclose the following:

- (a) that management has concluded that the financial statements present fairly the NPO’s financial position, income and expenses, other changes in net assets and cash flows;

- (b) that it has complied with INPAS, except that it has departed from a particular requirement to achieve a fair presentation; and

- (c) the nature of the departure, including the treatment that INPAS would require, the reason why that treatment would be so misleading in the circumstances that it would conflict with the objective of general purpose financial reports set out in A2 and the treatment adopted.

- B1.23 When an NPO has departed from a requirement of this Standard in a prior period, and that departure affects the amounts recognised in the financial statements for the current period, it shall make the disclosures set out in paragraph B1.22(c).

- In the extremely rare circumstances when management concludes that compliance with a requirement in INPAS would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of NPO general purpose financial reports set out in A2, but the relevant regulatory framework prohibits departure from the requirement, the NPO shall, to the maximum extent possible, reduce the perceived misleading aspects of compliance by disclosing the following:

- (a) the nature of the requirement in this Standard and the reason why management has concluded that complying with that requirement is so misleading in the circumstances that it conflicts with the objective of general purpose financial reports set out in A2; and

- (b) for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the financial statements that management has concluded would be necessary to achieve a fair presentation.

Presentation of information not required by this Standard

- B1.25 This Standard does not address presentation of segment information, earnings per share (if applicable) or interim financial reports by an NPO. An NPO making such disclosures shall describe the basis for preparing and presenting the information.

B2 – Statement of Financial Position

Scope of this Section

- This Section sets out the information that is to be presented in a Statement of Financial Position and how to present it. The Statement of Financial Position (sometimes called the balance sheet) presents an NPO’s assets, liabilities and net assets (comprising restricted funds, unrestricted funds, reserves (such as revaluation reserves) and, exceptionally, any equity claims and non-controlling interests) as of a specific date – the end of the reporting period.

Information to be presented in the Statement of Financial

- B2.2 The Statement of Financial Position shall include line items that present the following amounts:

- (a) cash and cash equivalents;

- (b) operating and other receivables;

- (c) financial assets (excluding amounts shown under a), b), k) and l));

- (d) inventories;

- (e) property, plant and equipment (including bearer plants in the scope of E2 Property, plant and equipment);

- (f) investment property carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment;

- (g) investment property carried at fair value through surplus or deficit;

- (h) intangible assets;

- (i) biological assets in the scope of E6 Specialised activities carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment;

- (j) biological assets in the scope of E6 carried at fair value through surplus or deficit;

- (k) investments in associates;

- (l) investments in jointly controlled entities;

- (m) operating and other payables;

- (n) financial liabilities (excluding amounts shown under m) and q));

- (o) liabilities and assets for current tax;

- (p) deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets (these shall always be classified as noncurrent);

- (q) provisions;

- (r) non-controlling interest, presented within net assets;

- (s) equity claims, being the cumulative total at the reporting date of contributions from holders of equity claims less distributions to holders of equity claims;

- (t) reserves (for example, a revaluation reserve);

- (u) the aggregate of restricted funds; and

- (v) the aggregate of unrestricted funds.

- An NPO shall present additional line items (including by disaggregating the line items listed in paragraph B2.2), headings and subtotals in the Statement of Financial Position when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the NPO’s financial position.

Current/non-current distinction

- An NPO shall present current and non-current assets, and current and non-current liabilities, as separate classifications in its Statement of Financial Position in accordance with paragraphs B2.5–B2.8, except when a presentation based on liquidity provides information that is reliable and more relevant. When that exception applies, all assets and liabilities shall be presented in order of approximate liquidity (ascending or descending).

Current assets

- B2.5 An NPO shall classify an asset as current when:

- (a) it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in the NPO’s normal operating cycle;

- (b) it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of its operating activities;

- it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting date; or

- (d) the asset is cash or a cash equivalent, unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

- B2.6 An NPO shall classify all other assets as non-current. When the NPO’s normal operating cycle is not clearly identifiable, its duration is assumed to be twelve months.

Current liabilities

- B2.7 An NPO shall classify a liability as current when:

- (a) it expects to settle the liability in the NPO’s normal operating cycle;

- it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of its operating activities;

- the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or

- (d) the NPO does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

- B2.8 An NPO shall classify all other liabilities as non-current.

Normal operating cycle

- There is a rebuttable presumption that an NPO’s operating cycle is 12 months. Where the presumption is rebutted, the normal operating cycle of an NPO is the time taken to convert inputs or resources into outputs. For instance, an NPO may receive donations or grants and use these resources to deliver services to meet the NPO’s objectives.

Sequencing of items and format of items in the Statement of Financial Position

- This Standard does not prescribe the sequence or format in which items are to be presented. Paragraph B2.2 simply provides a list of items that are sufficiently different in nature or function to warrant separate presentation in the Statement of Financial Position. In addition:

- (a) line items are included when the size, nature or function of an item or aggregation of similar items is such that separate presentation is relevant to an understanding of the NPO’s financial position; and

- (b) the descriptions used and the sequencing of items or aggregation of similar items may be amended, according to the nature of the NPO and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to an understanding of the NPO’s financial position.

- B2.11 The judgement on whether additional items are presented separately is based on an assessment of all the following:

- the amounts, nature and liquidity of assets;

- the function of assets within the NPO; and

- the amounts, nature and timing of liabilities.

Information to be presented either in the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes

- B2.12 An NPO shall disclose, either in the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes, the following subclassifications of the line items presented:

- (a) property, plant and equipment in classifications appropriate to the NPO;

- (b) cash and cash equivalents, showing separately cash that may not be available for use by the NPO (comprising cash and cash equivalents that have restrictions due to reasons such as foreign exchange controls, or legal restrictions – for example, the retention of cash in a specified bank account);

- (c) operating and other receivables, showing separately amounts receivable from related parties, amounts and receivables from other parties;

- (d) inventories, showing separately amounts of inventories:

- (i) held for sale in the ordinary course of operations;

- (ii) held for distribution in the ordinary course of operations;

- (iii) in the process of production for such sale; and

- (iv) in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services;

- (e) operating and other payables, showing separately amounts payable to operating suppliers, payable to related parties, deferred income and accruals; and

(f) provisions for employee benefits and other provisions.

- B2.13 The use of separate columns to present items in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of restricted funds and unrestricted funds is not required.

- B2.14 An NPO shall disclose an analysis of the movements of net assets, either on the face of the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes, showing separately material individual reserves or funds, unless such information is required by B8 Fund accounting.

- B2.15 In addition to the disclosures in paragraph B2.12, an NPO with share capital shall disclose the following, either in the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes for each class of share capital:

- (a) the number of shares authorised;

- (b) the number of shares issued and fully paid and issued but not fully paid;

- (c) par value per share or that the shares have no par value;

- (d) a reconciliation of the number of shares outstanding at the beginning and at the end of the period. This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods;

- (e) the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to that class, including restrictions on the distribution of dividends and the repayment of capital;

- (f) shares in the entity held by the NPO or by its controlled entities or associates; and

- (g) shares reserved for issue under options and contracts for the sale of shares, including the terms and amounts.

- B2.16 An NPO with equity claims other than share capital, such as a partnership or trust, shall disclose information equivalent to that required by paragraph B2.15, showing changes during the period in each category of equity claims and the rights, preferences and restrictions attaching to it.

- B2.17 If at the reporting date an NPO has a binding sale agreement for a major disposal of assets, or a group of assets and liabilities, the NPO shall disclose the following information:

- (a) a description of the asset(s) or the group of assets and liabilities;

- (b) a description of the facts and circumstances of the sale; and

- (c) the carrying amount of the assets or, if the disposal involves a group of assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities.

B3 – Statement of Income and Expenses

Scope of this Section

- B3.1 This Section requires an NPO to present its income and expenses for a period – that is, its financial activity for the period. It sets out the information that is to be presented in this statement and how to present it.

Presentation of income and expenses

- B3.2 An NPO shall present a Statement of Income and Expenses that presents all items of income and expense recognised in the period, except those that are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets as permitted or required by this Standard.

- B3.3 The face of the Statement of Income and Expenses may be presented with separate columns for aggregated income and expenses with restrictions and aggregated income and expenses without restrictions.

- B3.4 The effects of corrections of errors and changes in accounting policies are presented as retrospective adjustments of prior periods instead of as part of surplus or deficit in the period in which they arise (see B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors).

- B3.5 The Statement of Income and Expenses shall include all items of income and expense recognised in a period unless this Standard requires otherwise. An NPO shall present its unrealised gains or losses from fair value adjustments as part of the surplus or deficit, except where these gains or losses are recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets (see paragraph B3.6). These should be presented after surplus or deficit from operating activities in arriving at the total surplus or deficit of the NPO. Disclosure shall be made of unrealised gains and losses from fair value adjustment to:

- (a) investment properties that are carried at fair value through surplus or deficit

- (b) financial instruments that are carried at fair value through surplus or deficit

- (c) defined benefit pensions where actuarial adjustments are recognised through surplus or deficit.

- B3.6 Four types of unrealised gains or losses are recognised directly in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets (see B4 Statement of Changes in Net Assets) outside of surplus or deficit when prescribed by this Standard:

- (a) some gains and losses arising on translating the financial statements of a foreign operation (see A5 Foreign currency translation);

- (b) some actuarial gains and losses (see D4 Employee benefits);

- (c) some changes in fair values of hedging instruments (see F1 Part II Other financial instrument issues); and

- (d) changes in the revaluation surplus for property, plant and equipment, measured in accordance with the revaluation model (see E2 Property, plant and equipment).

- B3.7 As a minimum an NPO shall include, in the Statement of Income and Expenses, line items that present the following amounts for the period:

- (a) revenue;

- (b) finance costs;

- (c) share of the surplus or deficit of investments in associates (see G2 Investments in associates) and jointly controlled entities (see G3 Joint arrangements), accounted for using the equity method;

- (d) tax expense, excluding tax allocated to items (e), (g) and (h) (see paragraph D8.42);

- (e) a single amount comprising the total of:

- (i) the post-tax surplus or deficit of a discontinued operation; and

- (ii) the post-tax gain or loss attributable to an impairment, or reversal of an impairment, of the assets in the discontinued operation (see E5 Impairment of assets), both at the time and subsequent to being classified as a discontinued operation and to the disposal of the net assets constituting the discontinued operation;

- (f) surplus or deficit from operating activities;

- (g) each unrealised gain or loss (see paragraph B3.5) classified by nature (excluding amounts in (h));

- (h) share of the gains or losses of associates and jointly controlled entities accounted for using the equity method; and

- (i) total surplus or deficit.

- B3.8 An NPO shall disclose separately in the Statement of Income and Expenses as allocations for the period the surplus or deficit for the period attributable to:

(a) non-controlling interest;

- (b) holders of equity claims.

- B3.9 An NPO shall present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the Statement of Income and Expenses when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the NPO’s financial performance.

- B3.10 An NPO shall not present or describe any items of income and expense as ‘extraordinary items’ in the Statement of Income and Expenses or in the notes.

Analysis of expenses

- B3.11 An NPO shall present an analysis of expenses that provides information that is reliable and more relevant to the primary users of an NPO’s general purpose financial report in accordance with D1 Classification of expenses.

B4 – Statement of Changes in Net Assets

Scope of this Section

- B4.1 This Section sets out requirements for presenting the changes in an NPO’s net assets for a period.

Presentation

- The Statement of Changes in Net Assets presents an NPO’s surplus or deficit for a reporting period, gains or losses that are not taken through the Statement of Income and Expenses (see paragraph B3.6), movements between funds, the effects of changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors recognised in the period, and the amounts of contributions by and distributions to holders of equity claims during the period.

- An NPO shall present in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for restricted funds, unrestricted funds, other reserves (for example, revaluation reserves) equity claims and non-controlling interests that together comprise net assets, a reconciliation between the carrying amount at the beginning and the end of the period, separately disclosing:

- (a) surplus or deficit;

- (b) for each component of net assets, the effects of changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors recognised in accordance with B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors;

- (c) for each component of net assets, changes resulting from gains or losses that are recognised directly in net assets (see paragraph B3.6);

- (d) total income and expenses, to be a subtotal of (a), (b) and (c), showing separately any amount relating to a non-controlling interest;

- (e) changes resulting from movements between restricted funds and unrestricted funds, and any of the other identified components; and

- (f) changes resulting from movements in equity claims, including contributions by and distributions to holders of equity claims.

Where components of net assets include items which will be reclassified to surplus or deficit when specific conditions are met (see F1 Part II Financial instruments issues) they shall be grouped separately from items which will not be reclassified subsequently.

- An NPO shall provide a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and the end of the period, in line with B4.3, of any material subcomponents of net assets in the notes to the accounts, which aggregate to the components shown on the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

B5 – Statement of Cash Flows

Scope of this Section

- B5.1 This Section sets out the information that is to be presented in a Statement of Cash Flows and how to present it. The Statement of Cash Flows provides information about the changes in cash and cash equivalents of an NPO for a reporting period, showing separately changes from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.

Cash equivalents

- Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are held to meet short-term cash commitments instead of for investment or other purposes. Consequently, an investment normally qualifies as a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. Bank overdrafts are normally considered financing activities similar to borrowings. However, if they are repayable on demand and form an integral part of an NPO’s cash management, bank overdrafts are a component of cash and cash equivalents.

Information to be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows

- An NPO shall present a Statement of Cash Flows that presents cash flows for a reporting period classified by operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.

Operating activities

- B5.4 Operating activities are the principal activities of the NPO. Consequently, cash flows from operating activities generally result from the transactions and other events and conditions that enter into the determination of surplus or deficit. Examples of cash flows from operating activities are:

- (a) cash receipts from grants and donations;

- (b) cash receipts from the rendering of services and the sale of goods;

- (c) cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue;

- (d) cash payments to suppliers for goods and services;

- (e) cash payments to and on behalf of employees;

- (f) cash payments or refunds of income tax, unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities;

- (g) cash receipts and payments from investments, loans and other contracts held for dealing

- or trading purposes, which are similar to inventory acquired specifically for resale; and

- (h) cash receipts and payments from advances and loans made to other parties where such transactions are the NPO’s primary objective.

Some transactions, such as the sale of an item of property, plant or equipment, may give rise to a gain or loss that is included in surplus or deficit. However, the cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows from investing activities. Where an NPO receives a cash grant or donation specifically for the acquisition or construction of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other long-term assets the cash grant or donation shall be separately disclosed.

Investing activities

- B5.5 Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents. Examples of cash flows arising from investing activities are:

- (a) cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment (including self-constructed property, plant and equipment), intangible assets and other long-term assets;

- (b) cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long- term assets;

- (c) cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities (other than payments for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or trading);

- (d) cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities (other than receipts for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or trading);

- (e) cash advances and loans made to other parties (except where such transactions are the NPO’s primary objective which, consistent with paragraph B5.4(h), which should be treated as operating activities);

- (f) cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties (except where such transactions are the NPO’s primary objective which, consistent with paragraph B5.4(h), which should be treated as operating activities);

- (g) cash payments for futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the payments are classified as financing activities; and

- (h) cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the receipts are classified as financing activities.

When a contract is accounted for as a hedge (see F1 Part II Financial instruments Issues), an NPO shall classify the cash flows of the contract in the same manner as the cash flows of the item being hedged.

Financing activities

- B5.6 Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the borrowings and equity claims of an NPO. Examples of cash flows arising from financing activities are:

- (a) cash proceeds from contributions from holders of equity claims (including the issue of shares, if applicable);

- (b) cash payments to holders of equity claims to acquire or redeem the NPO’s equity claims;

- (c) cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages and other short- term or long-term borrowings;

- (d) cash repayments of amounts borrowed; and

- (e) cash payments by a lessee for the reduction of the outstanding liability relating to a finance lease.

Reporting cash flows from operating activities

- B5.7 An NPO shall present cash flows from operating activities using either:

- (a) the indirect method, whereby surplus or deficit is adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or

payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows; or

- (b) the direct method, whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments are disclosed.

Indirect method

- B5.8 Under the indirect method, the net cash flow from operating activities is determined by adjusting surplus or deficit for the effects of:

- (a) changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;

- (b) non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, deferred tax, accrued income (expenses) not yet received (paid) in cash, unrealised foreign currency gains and losses, undistributed profits of associates and donations of goods and services; and

- (c) all other items for which the cash effects relate to investing or financing.

An NPO shall not include donations of non-cash items, for example, donated inventory in the Statement of Cash Flows.

Direct method

- B5.9 Under the direct method, net cash flow from operating activities is presented by disclosing information about major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments. Such information may be obtained either:

- (a) from the accounting records of the NPO, or

- (b) by adjusting income, expenses and other items in the Statement of Income and Expenses for:

- (i) changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;

- (ii) other non-cash items; and

- (iii) other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows.

Reporting cash flows from investing and financing

- An NPO shall present separately major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments arising from investing and financing activities. The aggregate cash flows arising from acquisitions and from disposals of controlled entities or other business units shall be presented separately and classified as investing activities.

- An NPO shall record cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency in the NPO’s functional currency by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the cash flow.

- B5.12 The NPO shall translate cash flows of a foreign controlled entity at the exchange rates between the NPO’s functional currency and the foreign currency at the dates of the cash flows.

- B5.13 Paragraph A5.22 explains when an exchange rate that approximates the actual rate can be used.

- B5.14 Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not cash flows. However, to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the period, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency must be presented in the Statement of Cash Flows. Consequently, the NPO shall remeasure cash and cash equivalents held during the reporting period (such as amounts of foreign currency held and foreign currency bank accounts) at period-end exchange rates. The NPO shall present the resulting unrealised gain or loss separately from cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

Interest, capital distributions and dividends

- B5.15 An NPO shall present separately cash flows from interest and capital distributions received and paid as well as dividends received. The NPO shall classify cash flows consistently from period to period as operating, investing or financing activities.

- An NPO may classify interest paid and interest, capital distributions and dividends received as operating cash flows because they are included in surplus or deficit from operating activities. Alternatively, the NPO may classify interest paid and interest, capital distributions and dividends received as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs of obtaining financial resources or returns on investments.

- An NPO may classify distributions to holders of equity claims paid as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining financial resources. Alternatively, the NPO may classify distributions to holders of equity claims paid as a component of cash flows from operating activities because they are paid out of operating cash flows.

- B5.18 An NPO shall present separately cash flows arising from income tax and shall classify them as cash flows from operating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities. When tax cash flows are allocated over more than one class of activity, the NPO shall disclose the total amount of taxes paid.

Non-cash transactions

- An NPO shall exclude from the Statement of Cash Flows investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents. An NPO shall disclose such transactions elsewhere in the financial statements in a way that provides all the relevant information about those investing and financing activities.

- B5.20 Many investing and financing activities do not have a direct impact on current cash flows even though they affect the capital and asset structure of an NPO. The exclusion of non-cash transactions from the Statement of Cash Flows is consistent with the objective of a Statement of Cash Flows because these items do not involve cash flows in the current period. Examples of non-cash transactions are:

- (a) the receipt of donated assets;

- (b) the acquisition of assets either by assuming directly related liabilities or by means of a finance lease;

- (c) the acquisition of an entity by means of an equity issue; and

- (d) the conversion of debt to equity.

Changes in liabilities arising from financing activities

- An NPO shall disclose a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the Statement of Financial Position for liabilities arising from financing activities. Liabilities arising from financing activities are liabilities for which cash flows were, or future cash flows will be, classified in the Statement of Cash Flows as cash flows from financing activities. The reconciliation shall include:

- (a) changes from financing cash flows;

- (b) changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses;

- (c) the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates;

- (d) changes in fair values; and

- (e) other changes.

Supplier finance arrangements

- Supplier finance arrangements are characterised by one or more finance providers offering to pay amounts an entity owes its suppliers and the entity agreeing to pay according to the terms and conditions of the arrangements at the same date as, or a date later than, suppliers are paid. These arrangements provide the NPO with extended payment terms, or the NPO’s suppliers with early payment terms, compared to the related invoice payment due date. Supplier finance arrangements are often referred to as ‘supply chain finance’, ‘payables finance’ or ‘reverse factoring arrangements’. Examples of arrangements that are not supplier finance arrangements include:

- (a) arrangements that are solely credit enhancements for an entity (for example, financial guarantees including letters of credit used as guarantees); and

- (b) instruments used by an entity to settle directly with a supplier the amounts owed (for example, a situation in which an entity uses a credit card to settle the amount owed to a supplier and then has an obligation to pay the issuing bank instead).

- B5.23 An NPO shall disclose in aggregate for its supplier finance arrangements:

- the key terms and conditions of the arrangements (for example, terms and conditions related to the interest rate, fees charges, extended payment terms and security or guarantees provided). However, an NPO shall disclose separately the terms and conditions of arrangements that have dissimilar key terms and conditions;

- (b) as at the beginning and end of the reporting period:

- (i) the carrying amounts, and associated line items presented in the NPO’s Statement of Financial Position, of the financial liabilities that are part of a supplier finance arrangement;

- (ii) the carrying amounts, and associated line items, of the financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (i) for which suppliers have already received payment from the finance providers, unless it is impracticable to do so. If it is impracticable to make this disclosure, the entity shall state that fact;

- (iii) the range of payment due dates (for example, 30–40 days after the invoice date) for both the financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (i) and comparable operating payables that are not part of the supplier finance arrangement. Comparable operating payables are, for example, operating payables of the NPO with other NPOs with similar objectives or within the same jurisdiction as the financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (i). If ranges of payment due dates

are wide, an NPO shall disclose explanatory information about those ranges or divide them into narrower ranges; and

- (c) the type and effect of non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of the financial liabilities disclosed in accordance with (b)(i). These non-cash changes include the effect of business combinations that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents (see paragraph B5.19). For example, an entity that buys goods and services from suppliers would typically classify the cash outflows to settle amounts owed to its suppliers as cash outflows from operating activities. If the entity owes its suppliers an amount that becomes part of a supplier finance arrangement, the entity – having considered the terms and conditions of the arrangement – might classify the cash outflow to settle the amount owed as a cash flow from financing activities. In such circumstances, the entity might not have reported any cash inflow from financing activities, in which case the outcome would be a non-cash change in liabilities arising from financing activities.

Components of cash and cash equivalents

- An NPO shall disclose the components of cash and cash equivalents and shall present a reconciliation of the amounts presented in the Statement of Cash Flows to the equivalent items presented in the Statement of Financial Position. However, the NPO is not required to present this reconciliation if the amount of cash and cash equivalents presented in the Statement of Cash Flows is identical to the amount similarly described in the Statement of Financial Position.

Other disclosures

- An NPO shall disclose, together with a commentary by management, the amount of significant cash and cash equivalent balances held by the NPO that are not available for use by the NPO. Cash and cash equivalents held by an NPO may not be available for use by the NPO because of, among other reasons, foreign exchange controls or legal restrictions (including restrictions imposed by donors). For example, exchange controls may mean that an NPO’s trading operation in one country is unable to transfer profits to the controlling NPO in another country, or restrictions imposed by a donor may mean that funds have to be retained in a specified bank account until used to fund specific activities.

B6 – Notes to the financial statements

Scope of this Section

- This Section sets out the principles underlying information that is to be presented in the notes to the financial statements and how to present it. Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of Income and Expenses, the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and the Statement of Cash Flows. Notes provide narrative descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those statements and information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements. In addition to the requirements of this Section, nearly every other section of this Standard requires disclosures that are normally presented in the notes.

Structure of the notes

- B6.2 The notes shall:

- (a) present information about the basis of preparation of the financial statements and the specific accounting policies used, in accordance with paragraphs B6.5–B6.7;

- (b) disclose the information required by this Standard that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements; and

- (c) provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements but is relevant to an understanding of any of them.

- B6.3 An NPO shall, as far as practicable, present the notes in a systematic manner. An NPO shall cross-reference each item in the financial statements to any related information in the notes.

- B6.4 An NPO normally presents the notes in the following order:

- (a) a statement that the financial statements have been prepared in compliance with INPAS (see paragraph B1.20);

- (b) material accounting policy information (see paragraph B6.5);

- (c) supporting information for items presented in the financial statements, in the sequence in which each statement and each line item is presented; and

- (d) any other disclosures.

Disclosure of accounting policies

- B6.5 An NPO shall disclose material accounting policy information. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in the NPO’s financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.

Information about judgements

- An NPO shall disclose, along with material accounting policy information or other notes, the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see paragraph B6.7), that management has made in the process of applying the NPO’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Examples of judgements that an NPO might be required to disclose include those made in determining:

- (a) appropriate classes of assets and liabilities in accordance with paragraph A4.30 for which disclosures about fair value measurements are provided;

- (b) that the NPO has control of another entity; and

- (c) that the NPO has joint control of an arrangement or significant influence over another entity.

Information about key sources of estimation uncertainty

- An NPO shall disclose in the notes information about the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. In respect of those assets and liabilities, the notes shall include details of:

- (a) their nature; and

- (b) their carrying amount as at the end of the reporting period.

B7 – Accounting policies, estimates and errors

Scope of this Section

- B7.1 This Section provides guidance for selecting and applying the accounting policies used in preparing financial statements. It also covers changes in accounting estimates and correction of errors in prior period financial statements.

Selection and application of accounting policies

- B7.2 Accounting policies are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices applied by an NPO in preparing and presenting financial statements.

- B7.3 If this Standard specifically addresses a transaction, other event or condition, an NPO shall apply this Standard. However, an NPO need not follow a requirement in this Standard if the effect of doing so would not be material.

- B7.4 If this Standard does not specifically address a transaction, other event or condition, an NPO’s management shall use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is:

- (a) relevant to the decision-making needs of users; and

- (b) reliable, in that the financial statements:

- (i) represent faithfully the financial position, income and expenses, other changes in net assets and cash flows of an NPO;

- (ii) reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form;

- (iii) are neutral, that is, free from bias;

- (iv) are prudent; and

- (v) are complete in all material respects.

- B7.5 In making the judgement described in paragraph B7.4, management shall refer to, and consider the applicability of, the following sources in descending order:

- (a) the requirements and guidance in this Standard dealing with similar and related issues; and

- (b) the definitions, recognition criteria and measurement concepts for assets, liabilities, income and expenses and the pervasive principles in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles.

- B7.6 In making the judgement described in paragraph B7.4, management may also consider the requirements and guidance in other authoritative sources of accounting guidance dealing with similar and related issues:

- (a) primarily for exchange transactions, the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and full IFRS Accounting Standards (where the requirements or guidance do not conflict with the concepts and principles in A2);

- (b) primarily for non-exchange transactions, IPSAS (where the requirements or guidance do not conflict with the concepts and principles in A2); or

- (c) primarily for NPO-specific transactions not adequately addressed by the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, full IFRS Accounting Standards or IPSAS, jurisdictional-level accounting standards intended to be applied by an NPO where the requirements

or guidance does not conflict with the concepts and principles in A2 (including those standards superseded by INPAS).

In considering the relevance of other authoritative sources of accounting guidance, an NPO shall have regard to the specificity of the source (as a source that deals with the specific circumstances is likely to be more relevant than one from which the NPO must draw analogies), and the continued relevance of the source (as the passage of time may diminish the relevance of certain sources).

Consistency of accounting policies

- An NPO shall select and apply its accounting policies consistently for similar transactions, other events and conditions, unless this Standard specifically requires or permits categorisation of items for which different policies may be appropriate. If this Standard requires or permits such categorisation, an appropriate accounting policy shall be selected and applied consistently to each category.

Changes in accounting policies

B7.8 An NPO shall change an accounting policy only if the change:

- (a) is required by changes to this Standard; or

- (b) results in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events or conditions on the NPO’s financial position, income and expenses, other changes in net assets or cash flows.

- B7.9 The following are not changes in accounting policies:

- (a) the application of an accounting policy for transactions, other events or conditions that differ in substance from those previously occurring;

- (b) the application of a new accounting policy for transactions, other events or conditions that did not occur previously or were not material; or

- (c) a change to the cost model when a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available (or vice versa) for an asset that this Standard would otherwise require or permit to be measured at fair value.

- B7.10 If this Standard allows a choice of accounting treatment (including the measurement basis) for a specified transaction or other event or condition and an NPO changes its previous choice, that is a change in accounting policy.

- The initial application of a policy to revalue assets in accordance with E2 Property, Plant and Equipment is a change in an accounting policy to be dealt with as a revaluation in accordance with E2. Consequently, a change from the cost model to the revaluation model for a class of property, plant and equipment shall be accounted for prospectively, instead of in accordance with paragraphs B7.12–B7.13.

Applying changes in accounting policies

- B7.12 An NPO shall account for changes in accounting policy as follows:

- (a) a change in accounting policy resulting from a change in the requirements of this Standard in accordance with the transitional provisions, if any, specified in that amendment; and

- (b) all other changes in accounting policy retrospectively (see paragraph B7.13).

Retrospective application

- B7.13 When a change in accounting policy is applied retrospectively in accordance with paragraph B7.12, an NPO shall apply the new accounting policy to comparative information for prior periods to the earliest date for which it is practicable, as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. When it is impracticable to determine the individual-period effects of a change in accounting policy on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, an NPO shall apply the new accounting policy to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as at the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable, which may be the current period, and shall make a corresponding adjustment to the opening balance of each affected component of net assets for that period.

Disclosure of a change in accounting policy

- B7.14 When an amendment to this Standard has an effect on the current period or any prior period, or might have an effect on future periods, an NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the nature of the change in accounting policy;

- (b) for the current period and each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected;

- (c) the amount of the adjustment relating to periods before those presented, to the extent practicable; and

- (d) an explanation if it is impracticable to determine the amounts to be disclosed in (b) or (c).

Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.

- B7.15 When a voluntary change in accounting policy has an effect on the current period or any prior period, an NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the nature of the change in accounting policy;

- (b) the reasons why applying the new accounting policy provides reliable and more relevant information;

- (c) to the extent practicable, the amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected, shown separately:

- (i) for the current period;

- (ii) for each prior period presented; and

- (iii) in the aggregate for periods before those presented.

- (d) an explanation if it is impracticable to determine the amounts to be disclosed in (c).

Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.

Accounting estimates

- B7.16 An accounting policy may require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty – that is, the accounting policy may require such items to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed directly and must instead be estimated. In such a case, the NPO develops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective set out by the accounting policy. Developing accounting estimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions based on the latest available, reliable information.

- B7.17 An NPO uses measurement techniques and inputs to develop an accounting estimate. Measurement techniques include estimation techniques (for example, techniques used to measure depreciation for an item of property, plant and equipment, applying E2) and

valuation techniques (for example, techniques used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability applying A4 Fair value measurement).

Changes in accounting estimates

- B7.18 An NPO may need to change an accounting estimate if changes occur in the circumstances on which the accounting estimate was based or as a result of new information, new developments or more experience.

- B7.19 The effects on an accounting estimate of a change in an input or a change in a measurement technique are changes in accounting estimates, unless they result from the correction of prior period errors. A change in the measurement basis applied is a change in an accounting policy and is not a change in an accounting estimate. When it is difficult to distinguish a change in an accounting policy from a change in an accounting estimate, the change is treated as a change in an accounting estimate.

- B7.20 An NPO shall recognise the effect of a change in an accounting estimate, other than a change to which paragraph B7.21 applies, in surplus or deficit in:

- (a) the period of the change, if the change affects that period only; or

- (b) the period of the change and future periods, if the change affects both.

- B7.21 To the extent that a change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and liabilities, or relates to an item of net assets, the NPO shall recognise it by adjusting the carrying amount of the related asset, liability or net assets item in the period of the change.

Disclosure of a change in accounting estimates

- B7.22 An NPO shall disclose the nature of any change in an accounting estimate and the effect of the change on assets, liabilities, income and expense for the current period. If it is practicable for the NPO to estimate the effect of the change in one or more future periods, the NPO shall disclose those estimates.

Corrections of prior period errors

- B7.23 Prior period errors are omissions from, and misstatements in, an NPO’s financial statements for one or more prior periods arising from a failure to use, or misuse of, reliable information that:

- (a) was available when financial statements for those periods were authorised for issue; and

- (b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and taken into account in the preparation and presentation of those financial statements.

- B7.24 Such errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts and fraud.

- B7.25 To the extent practicable, an NPO shall correct a material prior period error retrospectively in the first financial statements authorised for issue after its discovery by:

- (a) restating the comparative amounts for the prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or

- if the error occurred before the earliest prior period presented, restating the opening balances of assets, liabilities and net assets for the earliest prior period presented.

- B7.26 When it is impracticable to determine the effects of an error on comparative information for one or more prior periods presented, the NPO shall restate the opening balances of

assets, liabilities and net assets for the earliest period for which retrospective restatement is practicable (which may be the current period).

Disclosure of prior period errors

- B7.27 An NPO shall disclose the following about prior period errors:

- (a) the nature of the prior period error;

- (b) for each prior period presented, to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction for each financial statement line item affected;

- (c) to the extent practicable, the amount of the correction at the beginning of the earliest prior period presented; and

- (d) an explanation if it is not practicable to determine the amounts to be disclosed in (b) or (c).

Financial statements of subsequent periods need not repeat these disclosures.

B8 – Fund accounting

Scope of this Section

- B8.1 Fund accounting is one of the key concepts in this Standard. All income and expense transactions are recorded against a fund to allow balances on the fund to be presented. As such, an NPO will have at least one fund. This fund can be known by a variety of terms, such as the General Fund, accumulated fund, or general reserve. INPAS uses the term General Fund. Unless other funds exist, the General Fund will contain all the historical surpluses and deficits of an NPO.

- B8.2 This Section sets out the characteristics of a fund for the purposes of INPAS and how each fund shall be presented in the general purpose financial statements.

Characteristics of a fund

- B8.3 A pre-requisite for fund accounting is an understanding by an NPO of the different funds it holds. A fund other than the General Fund may exist for a variety of reasons.

- B8.4 For the purposes of INPAS a separate fund shall be created where:

- (a) there is a requirement arising from legal or equivalent means to separately track resources and the use of those resources; or

- (b) there are reasonable expectations by an individual stakeholder or a group of stakeholders (internal or external) that an NPO will track resources used for a specific set of activities.

- B8.5 An NPO shall record the income, expenses, non-financial assets, non-current liabilities and any assets or liabilities relating to delivery obligations for each fund identified in paragraph B8.4. An NPO shall track other current assets and current liabilities where the information is available without undue cost or effort.

- B8.6 An NPO shall determine whether it has only one fund or multiple funds. An NPO that does not identify any additional funds after applying paragraph B8.4 will have one fund which will be the General Fund.

- The income, expenses, assets and liabilities recorded against each fund shall only relate to the activities undertaken to further the specific purposes of the fund and shall not relate to any other purpose. Expenses can include direct costs, shared costs and support costs (as defined in D1 Classification of expenses) unless they are not permitted as part of a given fund for legal, regulatory or other reasons.

- Where a fund exists in accordance with paragraph B8.4 it shall be presented as either a restricted fund or an unrestricted fund. An assessment shall be carried out at each reporting date to determine whether each individually identified fund shall be presented as a restricted fund (see paragraphs B8.9–B8.16) or an unrestricted fund (see paragraphs B8.17– B8.21).

Restricted funds

- B8.9 An NPO shall present a fund as a restricted fund when one of the following criteria are met:

- (a) use of the resources in the fund is limited to a specific purpose or activity because of an externally imposed requirement arising from legal or equivalent means. This includes

the acceptance of privately communicated terms by the grantor or donor that limit the use of resources to a specific purpose or activity; or

- (b) an NPO has made an externally communicated public commitment at or before the launch of a fundraising campaign that the NPO will use the resources obtained through the campaign for a specific purpose, creating a reasonable expectation on the use of resources.

- Generally, revenue from contracts with customers will be part of an unrestricted fund and these transactions on their own will not be sufficient to create a restricted fund. However, a restricted fund may include multiple sources of funds including revenue from contracts with customers.

- B8.11 It is possible that an NPO has many individual funds that have restrictions. The number of funds will be determined by the operational requirements of each NPO.

- B8.12 A reasonable allocation of the support costs associated with managing a fund shall be presented as part of a fund, unless their inclusion is not permitted as set out in B8.7.

- A restricted fund shall show all the transactions related to its specific purpose. The legitimate costs attributable to a restricted fund shall be presented as part of the fund even if the balance on that fund is insufficient at that time to fund all the expenses. An NPO shall only charge such expenses to the fund if the specific purpose for which the fund was created is not yet complete.

- B8.14 Negative balances (shortfalls) shall be reviewed at the reporting date to determine if there is a temporary shortfall that will be addressed in a future reporting period or whether there is a permanent shortfall.

- B8.15 Where there is a realistic expectation that the NPO will receive future income to cover a shortfall, the NPO shall carry forward the negative balance. Where future income is not likely to be received to cover the shortfall, the NPO shall make good the shortfall from its unrestricted funds and disclose the reasons for this shortfall in line with paragraph B8.26(c).

- B8.16 When a fund that was previously presented as a restricted fund is no longer required because the reason it was established no longer exists (for example, the purpose has been achieved or all the funds used), any balance on the fund, whether positive or negative, shall be transferred to unrestricted funds and the fund closed where both the transfer and closure is legally allowed. Where not currently legally allowed the NPO will continue to report the balance on the fund until it can be transferred and/or closed.

Unrestricted funds

- B8.17 Unrestricted funds are those funds that the governing body of an NPO can use at its discretion to further the NPO’s missional purposes. The General Fund is an unrestricted fund.

- B8.18 An NPO’s governing body can internally designate funds for a specific purpose. This can include setting aside funds for a future project or commitment, such as investment in new equipment to deliver the NPO’s missional objectives. The NPO shall present these internally designated funds as unrestricted funds because the NPO’s governing body has the discretion to alter any such allocations.

- B8.19 Unrestricted funds shall include:

- (a) any fund that an NPO’s governing body has created by internal designation; and

- (b) any other fund that is not presented as a restricted fund.

- B8.20 An NPO may receive a grant or donation where the grantor expresses a form of non-binding preference as to the use of the funds, which falls short of imposing a requirement through legal or equivalent means. Where this preference does not create a reasonable expectation on the use of the resources by the stakeholder, the NPO shall include the funds as part of unrestricted funds.

- Applying other INPAS sections may result in reserves, such as the revaluation reserve arising from the revaluation of property, plant and equipment. Such reserves form part of an NPO’s overall net assets. An NPO shall show these reserves separately to restricted funds and unrestricted funds.

Transfers between funds

- B8.22 A transfer between funds may only be made where this is legally allowed.

- B8.23 An NPO may make a transfer between restricted funds and unrestricted funds for several reasons, including:

- (a) to make good the shortfall on a restricted fund;

- (b) to transfer a non-current asset from a restricted fund because there is no longer a restriction on its use;

- (c) where the grantor or donor releases the balance on a restricted fund to be used for any purpose; or

- (d) where the NPO can use the balance on a restricted fund for an alternative purpose without legal or regulatory consequences.

- B8.24 The total transfers recorded between separate funds, including between any restricted and unrestricted funds in the reporting period shall always net to nil.

Disclosures

- B8.25 In deciding on the most suitable form of presentation, an NPO shall consider the volume and complexity of the funds held by the NPO.

B8.26 The notes to the financial statements shall disclose:

- (a) information on individual fund balances, including the purpose of each fund;

- (b) details of the movements on funds during the reporting period, showing as a minimum total income, total expenses, total other changes and movements between funds, disaggregated by each fund required in paragraph B8.26(a) and reconciling the opening and closing fund balances;

- (c) details of the reasons for any transfers between restricted funds and unrestricted funds; (d) an explanation of any shortfall on a restricted fund at the end of the reporting period and plans to address the shortfall in subsequent financial reporting periods;

- (e) an explanation of balances on any restricted fund where the purpose of the fund has ceased and the balance has not been or cannot be transferred to an unrestricted fund; and

- (f) details of the planned use of any designated funds (where disclosed), explaining the purpose of the designation.

- B8.27 An NPO may aggregate small funds that are individually immaterial where they have a similar purpose. If it is not possible to aggregate small funds they shall be shown individually.

Group C –

Revenue

|  |
|  |


C1 – Revenue

Scope of this Section

- C1.1 This Section specifies the accounting for revenue by an NPO.

- C1.2 It applies to all revenue except:

- (a) equity contributions received (see F2 Liabilities and equity claims);

- lease agreements within the scope of D6 Leases;

- (c) insurance contracts;

- (d) financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations within the scope of G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements, F1 Financial instruments, G2 Investments in associates and G3 Joint arrangements that are not grants and donations; and

- (e) non-cash exchanges of goods or services between entities in the same line of business to help make sales to customers.

- A transaction might be partially within the scope of this Section and partially within the scope of the other INPAS sections set out in paragraph C1.2. If one of the other sections specifies how to initially measure any parts of the transaction, then an NPO shall first apply the measurement requirements in that section. Otherwise, the NPO shall apply this Section to initially measure those parts of the transaction.

Structure of C1

Part I or Part II

- C1.4 This Section comprises two parts: Part I Revenue from grants and donations and Part II Revenue from contracts with customers.

- Part I relates to accounting for revenue from grants, donations and similar income. This is revenue that arises from a transaction in which an NPO receives cash, a service, good or other asset from another entity or individual without directly providing any cash, or a service, good or other asset in return to the provider of those resources. This form of revenue is sometimes known as non-exchange revenue, non-reciprocal revenue or unrequited revenue.

- C1.6 Part I uses the term ‘grant’ to encompass items commonly described as grants but also items that may otherwise be described as donations, gifts and similar transfers of resources.

- C1.7 Part II relates to accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. This is revenue that an NPO earns from providing services, goods or other assets to customers (whether an entity or individual), usually at a market rate. This form of revenue is sometimes known as commercial revenue, exchange revenue, reciprocal revenue or requited revenue.

Determining the economic substance of a transaction

- C1.8 An NPO shall determine the part of C1 to apply to a revenue transaction based on the economic substance of that transaction. There may be situations where an NPO will need to apply both parts of C1 to an individual transaction (that is, an NPO may need to separate a transaction into a grant component – accounted for using Part I – and a customer contract component – accounted for using Part II).

- C1.9 Where an NPO receives resources to support its provision of services, and:

- (a) it has control of the economic resources transferred because it has the present ability to direct the use of the resource; and

- (b) the grantor does not receive directly cash, a service, good or other asset in return by NPO;

the economic substance of this transaction means that the NPO applies Part I for accounting for revenue from grants, donations and similar transfers.

- In contrast, where an NPO provides a service for a fee (including to grantors), the economic substance of this transaction involves the NPO directly providing a service in exchange for consideration. This means that the NPO applies Part II as it is accounting for revenue from contracts with customers.

- An NPO may be required to treat a component of a transaction as a grant expense (where D2 Expenses on grants and donations will apply). For example, goods or services provided at a significant subsidy may, in substance, be the provision of a grant, along with the goods or services.

Principles for revenue recognition and measurement

- C1.12 The general principles for recognising revenue are as follows:

- (a) if a revenue transaction (or component of a transaction) does not impose delivery obligations on the NPO or does not require the NPO to fulfil promises in a contract with customers, the NPO recognises revenue when the amounts are received or, if earlier, become receivable; and

- (b) if a revenue transaction imposes delivery obligations on the NPO or requires the fulfilment of promises in a contract with customers, the NPO recognises revenue only when the delivery obligations or promises are met.

- C1.13 If amounts are received before the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied, the NPO recognises a liability. This liability is subsequently derecognised, and revenue recognised, when the NPO has met the delivery obligations or promises.

- C1.14 An NPO shall measure revenue at the fair value of the asset received or receivable, or the reduction in a liability where the grantor forgives an NPO’s obligation.

Initial recognition of revenue from transactions with delivery obligations or contracts with customers

5-step model

- For revenue transactions that impose delivery obligations on the NPO or require the fulfilment of promises in a contract with customers, this Section contains a 5-step revenue recognition model common to Parts I and II. The objective of the model is for the NPO to recognise revenue that reflects the amount to which the NPO expects to be entitled for meeting each delivery obligation or promise. This model is applicable to revenue from grants and donations when a grant agreement includes one or more delivery obligations and to all revenue from contracts with customers. Each step is summarised below, highlighting the differences in terminology depending on which part applies to the transaction.

|  | Revenue from grant agreements with delivery obligations (Part I) | Revenue from contracts with customers (Part II) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - Identify the existence and nature of grant agreements with delivery obligations and contracts with customers. | Identify if there is a grant agreement with delivery obligations, and if so, identify the nature of the agreement, including identifying any components without a delivery obligation. | Identify the contract(s) with a customer. |
| 2 - Identify the delivery obligations or promises. | Identify the delivery obligations in the grant agreement that arise from undertakings given by the NPO. | Identify the promises in the contract. ‘Promises’ is used to refer to both the actions an NPO will undertake (equivalent to undertakings in Part |) and the obligation to carry out those actions (equivalent to delivery obligations in Part |). |
| 3 - Determine the transaction amount or price. | Determine the transaction amount (the total amount of the grant). | Determine the transaction price. |
| 4 - Allocate the transaction amount or price to the delivery obligations or promises. | Allocate the transaction amount to delivery obligations and other components of the agreement (where there is more than one delivery obligation or other obligations that are not delivery obligations). | Allocate the transaction price to the promises in the contract (where there is more than one promise). |
| 5 - Recognise revenue when (or as) the NPO satisfies a delivery obligation or fulfils a promise. | Recognise revenue when (or as) the NPO satisfies a delivery obligation. | Recognise revenue when (or as) the NPO fulfils a promise. |


Unfulfilled transactions

- C1.16 When a grant agreement with a delivery obligation (Part I) or a contract with a customer (Part II) is wholly unfulfilled, an NPO shall not recognise any asset, liability or revenue associated with that grant agreement or contract. The recognition of assets, liabilities and revenues commences when one party to the grant agreement or contract starts to fulfil their obligations.

- Similarly, where a part of the grant agreement with a delivery obligation or contract with a customer is equally unperformed, which includes where both parties have partly fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent, the NPO shall not recognise any asset, liability or revenue for the unperformed parts of the grant agreement.

- C1.18 Grant agreements and contracts with customers will be wholly unfulfilled if the NPO has not yet met any of its stated delivery obligations in the grant agreement or promises in a contract, and the grantor or customer has not yet paid, and is not yet obligated to pay, consideration to the NPO.

Economic substance of transactions where the amounts given and received are not approximately equal

Revenue – where an NPO provides services, goods or other assets and receives an amount of cash, services, goods or other assets that is not approximately equal

- C1.19 An NPO may receive an amount that is either higher or lower than the value of the services, goods or other assets it provides in return. Where this is the case, the NPO shall account for the substance of the transaction in accordance with paragraphs C1.20–C1.23.

Value received is below value of services, goods or other assets provided

- An NPO shall consider the substance of the transaction where the amount it receives is below the value of services, goods or other assets provided. The NPO shall determine whether the lower amount is because the NPO has provided a commercial discount or a grant or donation to the other party.

- C1.21 Where the NPO provides goods, services or other assets at a commercial discount, the NPO shall apply C1 Part II in accounting for the transaction.

- C1.22 When the NPO is providing a grant or donation along with the services, goods, or other assets, the NPO shall:

- (a) apply C1 Part II in accounting for the revenue; and

- (b) apply D2 to the amount of grants or donations provided.

The grant or donation provided by the NPO is the difference between the fair value of the services, goods or other assets provided, or to be provided, and the amount received or receivable.

Value received is above value of services, goods or other assets provided

- C1.23 When the amount received by an NPO is above the value of services, goods or other assets provided, the NPO is, in substance, receiving a grant or donation in addition to the payment for providing services, goods or other assets. The NPO shall therefore recognise the fair value of the services or goods provided in accordance with C1 Part II and the remainder (the grant or donation received) in accordance with C1 Part I.

Expenses – where an NPO acquires services, goods or other assets in exchange for an amount other than the fair value of the acquired items

- C1.24 An NPO that acquires goods or services for more than the fair value of those goods or services is in substance providing a grant to the other entity and shall apply D2 in accounting for the grant element of the transaction.

- C1.25 An NPO shall consider the substance of the transaction where it acquires goods or services for an amount that is less than the fair value of the goods or services it will receive. The NPO shall determine whether it has received a commercial discount or a grant or donation.

- C1.26 When the substance of the transaction is that the NPO has received a commercial discount, the NPO shall account for the acquisition of the services, goods or other assets in accordance with the relevant INPAS section.

- C1.27 When the substance of the transaction is that the NPO has received a grant or donation, the NPO shall recognise the grant or donation in accordance with C1 Part I. The NPO shall recognise the receipt of a grant or donation for the difference between the fair value of the services and goods received and the amount transferred. The NPO shall account for the element that relates to the acquisition of the services, goods or other assets in accordance with the relevant INPAS section.

Permitted exception

- C1.28 An NPO may elect not to reflect the grant or donation received or its intention to make a donation or grant where the difference is not material or the cost of identifying the grant or donation exceeds the likely benefit to users of the financial statements.

Revenue in foreign currencies

- C1.29 An NPO may receive revenue in a foreign currency. Measurement of revenue in a foreign currency will be determined by the date at which amounts are translated from the foreign currency to the reporting currency.

- C1.30 An NPO accounts for the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates after the inception of a grant agreement or contract with a customer in accordance with A5 Foreign currency translation.

Principal versus agent considerations

- C1.31 When another party is involved in fulfilling the requirements of a grant agreement or contract with a customer, an NPO shall determine whether the nature of its obligation is to fulfil the requirements itself (that is, the NPO is a principal) or to arrange for another party to meet those requirements (that is, the NPO is an agent). An NPO shall determine whether it is a principal or an agent for each delivery obligation in a grant agreement and each promise in a contract. An NPO cannot be an agent unless it has a present obligation to the grantor or customer.

- C1.32 An NPO is a principal if:

- (a) it is primarily responsible for meeting the requirements of the delivery obligation or contract;

- (b) when the NPO transfers goods to a service recipient or customer, the NPO obtains control of the specified goods as inventory before it transfers them to the service recipient or customer (that is, the NPO has inventory risk before the goods are transferred); or

- (c) when the NPO provides services to a service recipient or customer, it obtains control of the specified service or right to the specified good or service before:

- (i) it provides the services to the service recipient or customer; or

- (ii) it directs another party who is acting on the NPO’s behalf to provide the service to the service recipient or customer.

If none of the circumstances in (a)–(c) apply, the NPO is an agent.

- C1.33 An NPO that is a principal shall recognise the gross amount of revenue to which the NPO expects to be entitled for fulfilling the requirements of a grant agreement or contract.

- C1.34 An NPO that is an agent shall recognise as revenue the amount of any management or administration charge, fee or commission to which the NPO expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the requirements of the grant agreement or contract to be fulfilled.

Presentation

- C1.35 An NPO shall apply B8 Fund accounting to determine the presentation of grant revenue as part of a restricted fund or unrestricted fund.

Scope of Part I

- C1.36 Part I specifies the accounting for revenue from grants, donations and similar income (hereafter referred to as grant revenue) as described in C1.5.

- C1.37 In C1 Part I, the term ‘resource’ includes goods, services and other assets, which may encompass cash, financial assets or non-current assets. References to goods or services are to be read as incorporating references to cash and other assets.

- C1.38 D2 specifies the accounting for expenditure on grants, donations and similar transfers by an NPO as a grantor.

Types of grant revenue

- C1.39 Grant revenue may arise:

- (a) from transactions or grant agreements that:

- (i) impose no constraints on the NPO’s ability to use the grant revenue; or

- (ii) impose requirements that constrain an NPO’s ability to use the grant revenue, without imposing one or more delivery obligations; or

- (b) from grant agreements that have one or more delivery obligations.

- C1.40 A grant agreement is an agreement between two or more parties that creates rights and obligations. Grant agreements can be written, oral or implied by an NPO’s or sector’s customary practices.

- C1.41 Delivery obligations arise where the donor and the grant recipient each have both rights and obligations, enforceable through legal or equivalent means. Enforceability can arise from various mechanisms, so long as the mechanism(s) provide each entity with the ability to hold the parties accountable for the fulfilment of their obligations. An NPO must consider the substance rather than the legal form of a grant agreement or individual delivery obligation in assessing enforceability. A delivery obligation creates a present obligation for the NPO.

- C1.42 A delivery obligation must specify the separate and distinct:

- (a) outcomes the NPO is expected to achieve;

- (b) activities that the NPO is required to undertake with the resources; or

- (c) services, goods and other assets that the NPO will use internally or transfer externally.

- C1.43 For a grant agreement or delivery obligation to be enforceable, the grantor must be able to determine whether the NPO has complied with its obligations. If the obligations imposed on the NPO are not sufficiently specific, the grantor will not be able to make this determination, and any obligations within the grant agreement would not be delivery obligations.

- C1.44 A grant agreement that does not have delivery obligations may nevertheless include requirements that constrain an NPO’s ability to use the grant revenue. These requirements do not create a present obligation for the NPO.

Enforceability

- C1.45 Grant agreements can be evidenced in several ways (see paragraph C1.40). While grant agreements are usually enforceable as a whole, there may be some agreements where enforceability applies to individual delivery obligations.

- C1.46 A grant agreement is enforceable if the agreement includes:

- (a) clearly specified rights and obligations for each involved party; and

- (b) remedies for non-completion by each involved party, which can be enforced through the identified enforcement mechanisms.

- C1.47 The NPO’s assessment of enforceability occurs at inception and subsequently when a significant external change indicates that there may be a change in the enforceability of that agreement.

- C1.48 A delivery obligation will not exist where it is not enforceable through legal or equivalent means and the grant agreement does not give both parties both rights and obligations.

Enforceability through legal or equivalent means

- C1.49 Whether a grant agreement is enforceable is based on an NPO’s assessment of the ability to enforce the specified terms and conditions of the grant agreement and the fulfilment of the other party’s stated obligations.

- C1.50 Enforceability may be through legal systems, or there may be alternative processes that have equivalent effect, depending on the parties involved in the grant agreement and the jurisdictions in which they are based (see B8).

- C1.51 For a grant agreement to be enforceable through ‘equivalent means’, the presence of an enforcement mechanism outside the legal system that is similar to the force of law without being legal in nature is required. This enforcement mechanism should:

- (a) establish the right of the grantor to obligate the grant recipient to complete the agreed obligation or be subject to remedies for non-completion; and

- (b) establish the right of the NPO to obligate the grantor to pay the agreed consideration.

- C1.52 Generally, the ability of a grantor to reduce or withhold future funding is not on its own a valid enforcement mechanism. This is because there is no present obligation on the grantor to provide the future funding, and the grant recipient has no right to receive future funding.

Enforceability as a result of rights and obligations

- Each party’s enforceable right(s) and obligation(s) within the grant agreement are interdependent and inseparable. This means that the grantor has the ability to obligate the recipient to complete the agreed obligation or be subject to remedies for not doing so, and the grant recipient is able to obligate the grantor to pay the agreed grant amount even if these rights are rarely, if ever, exercised.

- C1.54 The grant recipient’s right to obligate the grantor to pay the agreed grant amount may arise from the grant agreement providing that right or from the grant agreement requiring the grantor to pay the grant in advance, and the grantor doing so. In the latter case, the grantor

has complied with its obligation, and the grant recipient therefore does not need a remedy for non-compliance.

- C1.55 A general statement of intent will not create a grant agreement between a grantor and a recipient under which both parties have rights and obligations.

Accounting for grant agreements

- C1.56 An NPO will apply the recognition and measurement criteria in C1 Part I as follows:

- (a) grant revenue arising from transactions without delivery obligations is accounted for by applying paragraphs C1.58–C1.68; and

- (b) grant revenue from transactions with delivery obligations is accounted for by applying paragraphs C1.69–C1.105.

Figure C1.1 below summarises the process for determining how to apply Part I of this Section.

Figure C1.1: Decision tree illustrating how to apply Part I (Steps 1, 2 and 5)



This decision tree outlines the process for recognizing and presenting revenue from grants and donations.

Part 1: Recognition Phase

   Question 1: Does the grant or donation arise from an agreement?
       If NO:
           Action: Recognise revenue when the NPO controls the resource¹.
           (Proceed to the Presentation Phase below)
       If YES:
           Question 2: Is there more than one component to the agreement?
               If YES:
                   Action: Apply the following decision steps to each component separately.
               If NO (or for each component):
                   Question 3: Does the agreement/component impose one or more requirements on the NPO?
                       If NO:
                           Action: Recognise revenue when the NPO controls the resource¹.
                           (Proceed to the Presentation Phase below)
                       If YES:
                           Question 4: Is one or more of the requirements a delivery obligation?
                               If NO:
                                   Action: Recognise revenue when the NPO controls the resource¹.
                                   (Proceed to the Presentation Phase below)
                               If YES:
                                   Action: Recognise revenue when (or as) the NPO satisfies each delivery obligation (see Part II)².
                                   Final Presentation: Present as revenue with restrictions in accordance with B8.

---

Part 2: Presentation Phase

This phase follows after revenue has been recognized under the condition "Recognise revenue when NPO controls the resource¹".

Question 5: Does the donor have a reasonable expectation that the NPO will use the donation for a particular purpose?**
       If NO:
           Final Presentation: Present as revenue without restrictions in accordance with B8.
       If YES:
       Final Presentation: Apply B8 to determine if revenue is presented with or without restrictions.


Footnotes:

- 1 An NPO will control a resource when it has taken ownership of the resource or is legally entitled to the resource. An NPO will need to consider whether the substance of any requirements (for example, a match funding requirement) aﬀect its entitlement to a resource. The same recognition and measurement model is used for all transactions within the dotted box.

- 2 An NPO will need to consider whether the substance of any requirements (for example, a requirement to obtain regulatory approval) aﬀects the timing of when the NPO satisﬁes its delivery obligation.

Grant revenue from transactions without delivery

- Grant revenue from transactions without delivery obligations will result in an asset (cash, goods, services or another asset) and revenue for an NPO. An NPO does not recognise these assets until such time as it controls (that is, has a right to) those resources. The NPO shall recognise both the asset and revenue when the asset is received or when the amount becomes receivable.

- C1.59 The NPO shall measure the grant revenue and the corresponding asset (cash, receivable or other asset) at the fair value of the asset at the point at which it is recognised. Fair value shall be determined in accordance with A4 Fair value measurement.

- An NPO will not control the resources set out in a potential future grant agreement until such time as the NPO has a right to those resources, which will usually be when the agreement is signed. As the NPO cannot exclude or regulate the grantor’s access to the resources to be transferred, the NPO will need to establish that it has control of the resources before the NPO can recognise the asset.

Subsequent measurement

- C1.61 After initial recognition, an NPO shall subsequently measure:

- (a) cash and receivable assets in accordance with F1; and

- (b) all other assets in accordance with the relevant section of INPAS (examples include E1 Inventories and E2 Property, plant and equipment).

Donations in kind

- Donations in kind include donations of non-cash items such as property, plant and equipment, inventories and financial assets, and services such as volunteer time. Donations in kind are recognised and measured in accordance with paragraphs C1.58–C1.59 except as outlined in paragraphs C1.63–C1.68.

- C1.63 An NPO may apply one or more of the permitted exceptions in paragraph C1.64 to the general recognition and measurement requirements for revenue without a delivery obligation. These exceptions are not permitted for donations in kind provided to meet delivery obligations.

- C1.64 An NPO may elect to depart from the general recognition and measurement requirements by:

- (a) recognising revenue from low-value items donated for resale or to be transferred to another party in the course of the NPO’s fundraising activities, when the items are sold or the transfer related to the fundraising activity has taken place, measured at the amount of the consideration received or receivable;

- (b) recognising revenue from low-value items donated for distribution to service recipients or for an NPO’s own use when the items are distributed or used, measured at the fair value of the items at the time they are distributed or used; and/or

- (c) not recognising revenue in respect of any services in kind, except those that are critical to the NPO’s mission.

- C1.65 An NPO shall apply materiality in determining whether donated items are of low value.

- C1.66 Services in kind that are critical to an NPO’s mission are those services in kind that are involved in the delivery of the NPO’s mission, and where the NPO could not achieve all or a significant part of its overall mission without the receipt of the services in kind.

- C1.67 When applying a permitted exception, the NPO shall apply that exception to all items within a class of inventories, other assets or services in kind.

- C1.68 Donations in kind shall only be recognised when they can be measured reliably. Where an NPO does not recognise donations in kind, the NPO shall make the disclosures in paragraph C1.107.

Revenue from transactions with delivery obligations

- An NPO shall apply the 5-step model set out in paragraph C1.15. Part I specifies the requirements for a simplified version of the 5-step model that is expected to apply to most delivery obligations. When a delivery obligation includes more complex arrangements, the NPO shall apply the relevant guidance from Part II. Paragraphs AC1.1–AC1.4 set out how Part II is to be applied.

Step 1 – Identifying a grant agreement with delivery obligations

- An NPO completes this step by applying paragraphs C1.4–C1.11 to identify a grant agreement and determine that the agreement includes one or more delivery obligations. A delivery obligation is a grant recipient’s separately identifiable undertaking in a grant agreement to achieve a specified outcome, to carry out a specified activity or to use or transfer distinct services, goods or other assets. Delivery obligations specified in the grant agreement must be:

- (a) clearly defined;

- (b) enforceable (that is, consequences or remedies associated with non-delivery must be enforceable by legal or equivalent means); and

- (c) capable of being measured (that is, the achievement or progress towards achievement of delivery obligations must be capable of being measured).

Services, goods or other assets specified as delivery obligations may be used internally for a specified purpose or may be transferred to one or more service recipients.

Step 2 – Identifying delivery obligations in a grant agreement

- An undertaking in a grant agreement must create at least one delivery obligation as defined in C1.70. At the inception of the grant agreement, an NPO shall assess its commitments in the agreement and identify each of its separate delivery obligations in accordance with paragraph C1.42.

- C1.72 A delivery obligation is separate and distinct if both of the following criteria are met:

- (a) an outcome or activity (which may be the transfer of goods or services to service recipients) is separate from other outcomes or activities in the grant agreement; and

- (b) the resources (including goods or services) required by the grant agreement to complete the outcome or activity are separate from other resources required by the grant agreement.

- C1.73 A delivery obligation will generally explicitly state the outcomes, activities, services or goods that are required from an NPO. However, these may be implied by the customary practices of an NPO, a grantor or a sector in some jurisdictions.

- C1.74 Generally, delivery obligations do not include administrative tasks such as monthly monitoring reports. An NPO shall consider the substance of the task in determining whether the task is an administrative task.

Step 3 – Determining the transaction amount

- C1.75 The transaction amount is the amount of the grant to which an NPO expects to be entitled for fulfilling its delivery obligations. An NPO shall consider the terms of the grant agreement and its customary practices to determine the transaction amount.

- C1.76 When determining the transaction amount, an NPO shall assume that the grant will be received in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement as it exists at the transaction date and that it will not be cancelled, renewed or modified in the future.

- C1.77 If a grant agreement includes a single component that is the delivery obligation, the transaction amount will be the total amount of the grant, including any variable consideration.

Step 4 – Allocating the transaction amount to delivery obligations

- C1.78 Step 4 does not apply if:

- (a) an NPO fulfils all delivery obligations in a grant agreement in the same reporting period that the grant agreement begins; or

- (b) an NPO fulfils all delivery obligations in a grant agreement at the same point in time.

- C1.79 Step 4 also does not apply if a grant agreement contains a single delivery obligation. However, if the NPO accounts for the transfer of a series of distinct goods or services as a single delivery obligation and the transaction amount includes a variable grant amount, an NPO shall apply Part II in accounting for the variable amount in accordance with paragraph AC1.4. Paragraph C1.159 specifies how the NPO shall allocate the variable grant amount.

- C1.80 An NPO shall allocate the transaction amount to each delivery obligation identified in the grant agreement on a stand-alone value basis that is relative to the estimated costs.

- C1.81 The stand-alone value is the cost (including costs such as employee costs) the NPO expects to incur to fulfil a delivery obligation. Where a grant is only intended to contribute towards part of the costs of a specified activity or deliverable associated with a delivery obligation, the stand-alone value shall be adjusted to reflect any specific amount identified in the grant agreement or to reflect the proportion of the activity or deliverable covered by the grant agreement.

- C1.82 An NPO shall use the observable price of a good or service as the stand-alone value when the NPO acquires those goods and services in an observable market. Otherwise, the NPO shall estimate the stand-alone value.

- C1.83 When estimating a stand-alone value, an NPO shall take into account all information that is reasonably available to it, including market conditions, organisation-specific factors and negotiations with the grantor. An NPO shall apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances.

Step 5 – Recognising grant revenue when (or as) the NPO satisfies a

- An NPO shall recognise grant revenue when (or as) the NPO satisfies a delivery obligation. An NPO satisfies a delivery obligation by completing the activity or deliverable (which may be the transfer of goods or services to service recipients) using the required resources. Delivery obligations may be fulfilled over time or at a point in time (see paragraphs C1.87–C1.88).

- C1.85 Grant revenue is measured at the value of the transaction amount allocated to the delivery obligation that has been met (or proportionally to that amount if the delivery obligation has been partially met).

- An NPO shall recognise a delivery obligation liability where it has received a grant in advance of meeting its delivery obligations. An NPO shall recognise a delivery obligation asset where a delivery obligation has been met ahead of the amount being received (or the amount being due).

Delivery obligations fulfilled over time or at a point in time

- An NPO may fulfil delivery obligations to achieve an objective or carry out an activity over time or at a point in time. An NPO fulfils a delivery obligation over time if the NPO is entitled to grant revenue for the activities it has carried out to date; otherwise, the delivery obligation is fulfilled at a point in time.

- C1.88 For example, an NPO may have an obligation to deliver 1,000 vaccinations by the end of the project:

- (a) if the NPO is entitled to grant revenue for the vaccinations it has delivered, even if this is fewer than the agreed number, the NPO is entitled to grant revenue for the activities carried out to date, and the delivery obligation is fulfilled over time.

- (b) if the NPO is only entitled to grant revenue if the full 1,000 vaccinations are delivered, and the NPO is not entitled to revenue if fewer vaccinations are delivered, the NPO is not entitled to grant revenue for the activities carried out to date and the delivery obligation is fulfilled at a point in time, as the final vaccination is delivered.

Methods for measuring progress towards complete fulfilment of a delivery obligation

Output methods

- Output methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the proportion of the specified objectives achieved or specified activities carried out. Output methods include methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached and units produced or units delivered.

- C1.90 When an NPO evaluates whether to apply an output method to measure its progress, the NPO shall consider whether the output selected would faithfully depict the NPO’s performance towards complete fulfilment of the delivery obligation. An output method would not provide a faithful depiction of the NPO’s performance if the output selected would fail to measure some of the undertakings to use resources in the specified manner. For example, output methods based on activity would not faithfully depict an NPO’s performance in fulfilling a delivery obligation if the expected cost of delivering the remaining activity is significantly higher than that of the activity delivered to date.

- C1.91 When an NPO is required to transfer a distinct good or service to a service recipient, and the NPO has a right to grant revenue that corresponds directly with the value of the delivery obligations completed, the NPO may recognise revenue in the amount to which it is entitled.

- C1.92 The disadvantages of output methods are that the outputs used to measure progress may not be directly observable and the information required to apply them may not be available to an NPO without undue cost. Therefore, an input method may be necessary.

Input methods

- Input methods recognise revenue on the basis of the NPO’s efforts or inputs (for example, resources consumed, labour hours expended, eligible expenditures incurred or time elapsed) relative to the total expected inputs required to fulfil that delivery obligation. If the NPO expends effort or inputs evenly throughout the performance period, it may be appropriate for the NPO to recognise revenue on a straight-line basis.

- The grantor needs to be able to confirm that the NPO has fulfilled its delivery obligations in the specified manner. The NPO needs to keep appropriate documentation, which may include records of eligible expenditures incurred that directly relate to the fulfilment of the delivery obligations in the specified manner. The records on eligible expenditures will show the cost of the inputs required to fulfil the delivery obligations.

- C1.95 A shortcoming of input methods is that there may not be a direct relationship between an NPO’s inputs and the fulfilment of its delivery obligations. Therefore, an NPO shall exclude from an input method the effects of any inputs that do not affect the NPO’s performance in fulfilling its delivery obligation. For instance, a cost-based input method may require an adjustment to the measure of progress in the following circumstances:

- (a) when a cost incurred does not contribute to an NPO’s progress in fulfilling the delivery obligation. For example, an NPO would not recognise revenue on the basis of costs that include impairments as a result of damage to assets being used to meet the delivery obligation.

- (b) when a cost incurred is not proportionate to the NPO’s progress in fulfilling the delivery obligation, and that cost is significant relative to the total expected costs to completely satisfy the delivery obligation. In those circumstances, the best depiction of the NPO’s performance may be to adjust the input method to recognise revenue only to the extent of that cost incurred, that is, revenue is not recognised ahead of the costs incurred.

Grantor reporting, assurance or audit requirements

- Reporting, assurance or audit requirements may allow a grantor to cancel a grant agreement with delivery obligations, or require an NPO to take remedial action if the NPO does not comply with the requirements of a delivery obligation. An NPO shall consider the effect of such requirements when evaluating when a delivery obligation is fulfilled.

- If an NPO can objectively determine (that is, determine based on information available to it) that it has fulfilled the delivery obligation in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement, then the reporting, assurance or audit requirements are a formality that would not affect the determination of when the delivery obligation has been fulfilled. However, if an NPO cannot objectively determine that it has fulfilled the delivery obligation in accordance with the terms of the grant agreement, then it would not be able to conclude that the delivery obligation has been fulfilled until it receives the grantor’s confirmation that the requirements have been met.

Multi-year grants

- C1.98 Multi-year grant agreements generally involve the provision of resources over multiple years for a specific purpose or project. Funding may occur at multiple dates throughout a year and/ or across multiple years. Multi-year grant agreements can exist whether or not the grant agreement includes one or more delivery obligations.

- C1.99 While such grant agreements are longer term, the NPO shall consider whether an inflow, or a right to a future inflow, of resources gives rise to an asset, applying the same principles as a

grant agreement that covers a single period. Revenue recognition is assessed independently from and may be different to the timing of when funds are received.

- C1.100 In accordance with paragraph C1.16, when a grant agreement has a delivery obligation that relates to a future financial reporting period and neither party to the agreement has carried out activities or transferred resources (that is, neither party has performed), an NPO shall not recognise any asset, liability or revenue associated with the delivery obligation.

- C1.101 The NPO shall consider whether a delivery obligation or part of a delivery obligation relating to subsequent years is unfulfilled in determining whether any expected inflow of resources meet the definition of an asset. The NPO shall not recognise any asset, liability or revenue for those delivery obligations or parts of a delivery obligation which have not been performed by either party.

Capital grants

- C1.102 A capital grant arises when a grantor transfers, or is obligated to transfer, cash or another asset to an NPO and requires the NPO to acquire or construct a non-current asset that the NPO will then control. An NPO shall follow the same approach to recognising revenue involving a capital grant as with any other revenue.

- C1.103 Capital grants typically include substantial details about the various stages in the project (for example, conception and planning, design, procurement, construction, etc). These details are likely to mean that the capital grant includes one or more delivery obligations. These details can provide a basis for identifying each delivery obligation.

- C1.104 An NPO shall identify the individual delivery obligations and determine the appropriate measure of progress for each. Revenue recognition is independent of the timing of the receipt of resources from the grantor for each delivery obligation.

Delivery obligation costs

- C1.105 An NPO shall account for the costs incurred in fulfilling a delivery obligation in accordance with the relevant section of INPAS for those costs (for example, E1, E2 and E4 Intangible assets other than goodwill).

Disclosure

- C1.106 An NPO shall disclose the revenue recognised from grants, donations and other income, disaggregated into categories, showing separately, as a minimum, revenue without delivery obligations and revenue with delivery obligations. For each category of grants, donations and other income, an NPO shall further disclose the revenue received or receivable:

- (a) in cash;

- (b) as gifts in kind; and

- (c) as services in kind.

- C1.107 When an NPO receives donations in kind but does not recognise those donations in kind on receipt (whether as revenue, inventories or other assets), the NPO shall:

- (a) disclose a description of the donations in kind received and their significance to the NPO;

- (b) disclose an explanation of why it has not recognised the donations in kind – that is, why the NPO either:

- (i) has elected to use a permitted exception in accordance with paragraph C1.64, disclosing the exception or exceptions used; or

- (ii) is unable to reliably measure the value of the donations in kind; and

- consider disclosing any other information it holds that would help users of the financial statements understand the benefits to the NPO of the donations in kind it receives. In particular, the NPO shall consider disclosing any quantitative information available to the NPO – for example, the number of volunteers or hours of each type of service in kind received during the reporting period. An NPO is not required to generate quantitative information that it does not already hold for other purposes.

Grant revenue without delivery obligations

- C1.108 An NPO shall disclose the opening and closing balances of any receivables from grants, donations and similar income without delivery obligations if not otherwise separately presented or disclosed.

Grant revenue with delivery obligations

- C1.109 Unless the amounts are presented separately in the Statement of Income and Expenses by applying other sections of INPAS, an NPO shall disclose the amount of impairment losses recognised for the reporting period on any receivables or assets arising from an NPO’s delivery obligations, which the NPO shall disclose separately from other impairment losses for the reporting period.

- C1.110 An NPO shall disclose a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of receivables, delivery obligation assets and delivery obligation liabilities, if not otherwise separately presented or disclosed.

- C1.111 An NPO shall disclose information about its delivery obligations, including a description of:

- (a) when the NPO typically satisfies its delivery obligations (for example, upon delivery, as services are rendered or upon completion of service); and

- (b) significant grant payment terms.

- C1.112 For delivery obligations that an NPO fulfils over time, the NPO shall disclose the method(s) it used to recognise revenue.

- C1.113 An NPO shall provide a quantitative and/or qualitative explanation of the significant unfulfilled delivery obligations and when they are expected to be fulfilled.

- C1.114 An NPO need not disclose the information set out in paragraphs C1.112 and C1.113 if the delivery obligation is part of a grant agreement that has an original expected duration of one year or less.

Revenue recognition model

- C1.115 Part II applies the 5-step revenue recognition model in paragraph C1.15 to contracts with customers. An NPO shall apply Part II consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.

- C1.116 Part II specifies the accounting for an individual contract with a customer. An NPO may apply this Section to a portfolio of similar contracts (or promises) if the NPO reasonably expects that

the result of doing so would not differ materially from the result of applying the section to each individual contract (or promise).

Step 1 – Identify the contract(s) with a customer

- C1.117 A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an NPO’s usual business practices.

- C1.118 An NPO shall apply the revenue recognition model to account for a contract with a customer that is within the scope of this Section only when all of the following criteria are met:

- (a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract and are committed to fulfilling their respective obligations;

- (b) the NPO can identify each party’s rights in relation to the goods or services to be transferred;

- the NPO can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred;

- the contract has commercial substance; and

- (e) it is probable that the NPO will collect the consideration that it is entitled to when the consideration is due.

- C1.119 If a contract with a customer meets the criteria in paragraph C1.118 at the start of the contract, an NPO shall reassess whether the contract meets the criteria only if there is a significant change in relevant facts and circumstances.

- C1.120 If a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph C1.118, an NPO shall reassess the contract until the criteria are met.

- C1.121 When a contract with a customer does not meet the criteria in paragraph C1.118, an NPO shall recognise any consideration received from the customer as a liability. If the consideration is non-refundable, the NPO shall derecognise the liability and shall recognise the consideration as revenue when either:

- (a) the contract is complete and the NPO has received all, or almost all, of the consideration promised by the customer; or

- (b) the contract is cancelled.

- C1.122 Some contracts with customers might have no fixed duration or might automatically renew periodically. An NPO shall apply this Section to the duration of the contract (that is, the contractual period) in which the parties to the contract have present enforceable rights and obligations.

- C1.123 If a contract is modified, an NPO shall account for the contract modification by applying paragraphs AC1.6–AC1.8.

Combination of contracts

- C1.124 An NPO shall combine two or more contracts it has entered into at or near the same time with the same customer (or related parties of the customer) and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met:

- (a) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial objective;

- (b) the amount of consideration the customer will pay in one of the contracts depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or

- (c) the goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or services promised in each of the contracts) are a single promise in accordance with Step 2.

Step 2 – Identify the promises in the contract

- C1.125 A promise is an obligation to transfer a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services). A contract with a customer might contain more than one promise. At the start of a contract, an NPO shall identify the goods and services promised in the contract and determine which goods or services are distinct.

- C1.126 An NPO might transfer distinct goods or services to a customer that are essentially the same, but at discrete instances over time (that is, transfer a series of distinct goods or services). The NPO shall account for those goods or services as a single promise if:

- (a) each distinct good or service in the series would meet the criteria to be a promise fulfilled over time (see paragraph C1.165); and

- (b) the NPO would use the same method to measure its progress in transferring control of each distinct good or service in the series to the customer (see paragraphs C1.173–C1.178)

- C1.127 A contract with a customer usually explicitly states the goods or services that an NPO promises to transfer. However, promises might be implied by an NPO’s usual business practices, published policies or specific statements, if these create a valid expectation of the customer that the NPO will transfer a good or service to the customer.

- C1.128 A promise does not include activities that an NPO must undertake to fulfil a contract, such as set-up activities and administrative tasks, unless those activities transfer a good or service to a customer. Non-refundable fees charged to customers at or near the start of a contract often relate to activities that do not transfer a good or service to the customer and, therefore, do not give rise to a promise. In such cases, the non-refundable upfront fee is included in the transaction price and allocated to the promises in the contract in accordance with Steps 3 and 4.

Distinct goods or services

- C1.129 A good or service is distinct if both of these criteria are met:

- (a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer. A good or service that an NPO regularly sells separately is an example of a good or service that meets this criterion.

- (b) the NPO’s obligation to transfer the good or service is separate from other obligations in the contract.

- C1.130 If a good or service promised to the customer is not distinct, an NPO shall combine that good or service with other goods or services in the contract until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct. In some cases, the NPO will account for all the goods or services in a contract as a single promise.

- C1.131 For the purpose of applying the criterion in paragraph C1.129(a), resources readily available to the customer are:

- (a) goods or services sold separately (by the NPO or another entity); or

- (b) goods or services that the customer has already obtained from the NPO (including goods or services transferred to the customer under the contract) or from other transactions or events.

- C1.132 For the purpose of applying the criterion in paragraph C1.129(b), factors that suggest that the NPO’s obligation to transfer a good or service is not separate from other obligations in the contract include:

- (a) the NPO integrating the goods or services in the contract in a way that transforms them into a combined output, (or outputs) for which the goods or services are inputs. For example, a construction contract in which an NPO provides a contract management service that integrates various goods or services in a way that transforms them into the asset or assets to be constructed.

- (b) the good or service being modified or customised by another good or service in the contract to the extent it is transformed. For example, a contract in which an NPO promises to provide existing software and to customise that software, if the customisation service transforms the software.

- (c) the good or service being highly dependent on, highly related to or highly affected by another good or service in the contract. For example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are highly affected by each other because an NPO would not be able to fulfil its promise by transferring each of the goods or services separately.

- C1.133 Distinct goods or services can include:

- (a) warranties (see paragraphs AC1.9–AC1.11);

- (b) options to acquire additional goods or services (see paragraphs AC1.12–AC1.17);

- (c) arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to the customer if the NPO is acting as an agent (see paragraphs C1.31–C1.34); and

- (d) licences (see paragraphs AC1.25–AC1.34).

Step 3 – Determine the transaction price

- C1.134 The transaction price is the amount of consideration an NPO expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services promised to a customer, excluding amounts the NPO collects on behalf of third parties (for example, some sales taxes).

- C1.135 An NPO shall determine the transaction price based on the terms of the contract and its usual business practices. When determining the transaction price, an NPO shall assume the goods or services will be transferred to the customer in accordance with the contract. The NPO shall also assume the contract will not be cancelled, renewed or modified.

- C1.136 If the consideration promised by the customer is in a form other than cash, an NPO shall measure the non-cash consideration by applying paragraphs AC1.18–AC1.19.

Variable consideration

- C1.137 The consideration promised by a customer might vary, because of factors such as discounts, rebates, refunds, penalties or performance bonuses.

- C1.138 If the consideration includes a variable amount, an NPO shall measure the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price by:

- (a) estimating the amount of variable consideration (see paragraphs C1.139–C1.140); and

- (b) constraining that estimate (see paragraph C1.141).

- C1.139 An NPO shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using one of two methods:

- (a) the expected value method – the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. This might be an appropriate method if an NPO has many contracts with similar characteristics.

- (b) the most likely amount method – the most likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (that is, the most likely outcome of the contract). This might be

an appropriate method if the contract has only two possible outcomes (for example, an NPO either achieves a performance bonus or does not).

- C1.140 An NPO shall apply one method to estimate the amount of variable consideration consistently throughout the contract.

- C1.141 An NPO shall include in the transaction price an amount of variable consideration estimated in accordance with paragraph C1.139 only to the extent that it is highly probable that the NPO will become entitled to this amount when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is later resolved.

- C1.142 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall update the amount of variable consideration included in the transaction price to reflect any relevant changes in circumstances. An NPO shall allocate any subsequent changes in the transaction price to the promises in the contract on the same basis it used at the start of the contract. An NPO shall recognise amounts allocated to a fulfilled promise as revenue (or as a reduction of revenue) in the period in which the estimate changes.

- C1.143 An NPO shall apply paragraph AC1.34 to account for consideration in the form of a royalty based on sales or use that is received in exchange for a licence of intellectual property.

Refund liabilities.

- C1.144 If an NPO receives consideration from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the customer, the NPO shall recognise as a refund liability.

- C1.145 The NPO shall measure a refund liability by first applying paragraphs C1.138–C1.141 to measure the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price. The entity shall then recognise as a refund liability the amount of consideration received (or receivable) for goods or services transferred that is not included in the transaction price. At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall update the estimate of the refund liability to reflect consideration received (or receivable), goods or services transferred and changes in the transaction price in accordance with paragraph C1.142.

- C1.146 As an exception to paragraph C1.145, an NPO shall apply paragraphs AC1.20–AC1.24 to account for the variable consideration and refund liability relating to a sale with a right of return.

Deferred payment

- C1.147 If payment is deferred, and the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction (see paragraph F1.19), an NPO shall discount the promised amount of consideration at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument as determined at the start of the contract. An NPO shall recognise the difference between the promised consideration and the discounted value of that amount as interest revenue using the effective interest method (see paragraphs F1.22–F1.27).

- C1.148 The NPO shall present interest revenue separately from revenue from contracts with customers.

- C1.149 An NPO is permitted not to apply paragraphs C1.147–C1.148 if, at the start of a contract, it expects a customer to pay for goods or services within one year of the NPO transferring the goods or services.

Step 4 – Allocate the transaction price to the promises in

- C1.150 An NPO shall allocate the transaction price to each promise it has identified in the contract in accordance with paragraphs C1.151–C1.159.

- C1.151 Step 4 does not apply if an NPO fulfils all promises in a contract:

- (a) in the same reporting period that the contract begins; or

- (b) at the same point in time in accordance with paragraph C1.169.

- C1.152 Step 4 does not apply if a contract contains a single promise. However, an NPO shall apply paragraph C1.159 if the NPO accounts for a series of distinct goods or services as a single promise in accordance with paragraph C1.126 and the transaction price includes an amount of variable consideration.

Allocation based on stand-alone selling prices

- C1.153 At the start of a contract, an NPO shall determine the stand-alone selling price of the distinct good or service (or distinct bundle of goods or services) in each promise in the contract. The NPO shall allocate the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices (that is, on a relative stand-alone selling price basis). The NPO shall not reallocate the transaction price to reflect changes in the stand-alone selling prices after the start of the contract.

- C1.154 The ‘stand-alone selling price’ is the price at which an NPO would separately sell a good or service. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the NPO sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.

- C1.155 If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an NPO shall estimate the price. An NPO shall take into account all information that is reasonably available to the NPO, including market conditions, NPO-specific factors and information about the customer or class of customer. An NPO shall apply estimation methods consistently in similar circumstances. Suitable estimation methods might include using the NPO’s competitor’s prices for similar goods or services, or the expected costs of the good or service plus an appropriate margin.

- C1.156 As an exception to paragraph C1.153, an NPO might allocate a discount or variable consideration using an alternative method (see paragraphs C1.157–C1.159).

Allocation of a discount and variable consideration

- C1.157 In a contract:

- (a) a customer receives a discount if the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract is greater than the promised consideration.

- (b) the transaction price might include an amount of variable consideration (see paragraphs C1.137–C1.143).

- C1.158 An NPO shall allocate a discount or variable amount to each promise in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. However, if allocating the discount or variable amount on this basis does not represent the amount of consideration the NPO expects to be entitled to in exchange for fulfilling each promise in the contract, the NPO shall use another method to allocate the discount or variable amount. For example, the NPO might allocate the discount or variable amount to one, or some, of the promises in the contract.

- C1.159 If an NPO accounts for a series of distinct goods or services as a single promise in accordance with paragraph C1.126, it shall allocate a variable amount to each distinct good or service on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. However, if allocating the variable amount on this basis does not represent the amount of consideration the NPO expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring each distinct good or service in the promise, the NPO shall use another method to allocate the variable amount. For example, the NPO might allocate the variable amount to one, or some, of the distinct goods or services in the promise.

Step 5 – Recognise revenue when (or as) the NPO fulfils a

- C1.160 An NPO shall recognise revenue when (or as) it fulfils a promise. An NPO fulfils a promise by transferring control of the distinct good or service in the promise to the customer.

- C1.161 Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are received and used. An NPO transfers control of an asset when the customer has the present ability to direct the use of the asset and obtain the economic benefits that might flow from it.

- C1.162 When evaluating whether a customer obtains control of an asset, an NPO shall consider any agreements to repurchase the asset. The customer does not obtain control of the asset if the NPO has a right and obligation to repurchase the asset (a forward) or a right to repurchase the asset (a call option).

- C1.163 At the start of a contract, an NPO shall determine whether it transfers control of the distinct good or service in a promise to a customer either:

- (a) over time, in which case the NPO fulfils the promise (and recognises revenue) over time in accordance with paragraphs C1.165–C1.167; or

- (b) at a point in time, in which case the NPO fulfils the promise (and recognises revenue) at a point in time in accordance with paragraphs C1.168–C1.172.

- C1.164 If a contract with a customer includes a licence that is distinct from the other goods or services in the contract, an NPO shall apply paragraphs AC1.25–AC1.33 to determine whether the promise to grant the licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time.

Promises fulfilled over time

- C1.165 An NPO transfers control of a distinct good or service over time, and therefore fulfils a promise over time, if any of these criteria is met:

- (a) a customer receives and immediately uses the benefits from the NPO’s performance as the NPO performs (for example, a routine or recurring cleaning service);

- (b) a customer controls the asset as the NPO makes or improves the asset (for example, a construction contract in which the customer controls the work in progress); or

- (c) the asset created by the NPO’s performance cannot be easily redirected to another customer (see paragraph C1.166) and the original customer is obliged to pay the NPO for work done to date (see paragraph C1.167) (for example, a service contract in which an entity provides a professional opinion to a customer that is based on facts and circumstances specific to the customer, and it is obliged to pay the entity for work done to date).

- C1.166 An asset cannot be easily redirected to another customer if:

- (a) the NPO would either sell the finished asset to another customer at a significantly lower price than that paid by the original customer, or incur significant costs, compared with the cost of the asset, to rework the finished asset for sale (for example, if an asset was highly customised for a particular customer); or

- (b) substantive contractual restrictions prohibit the NPO from selling the asset to another customer as that asset is made or improved (for example, if the NPO is legally obliged to sell work in progress to the customer).

- C1.167 A customer might be obliged to pay an NPO for work done to date because of specific terms in the contract or laws that apply to that contract. The customer is obliged to pay the NPO for work done to date if the NPO has either:

- (a) a present unconditional right to payment for work done to date; or

- (b) an enforceable right to demand or keep payment for work done to date if the contract is cancelled before it is complete for any reason other than the NPO’s failure to perform as agreed.

Promises fulfilled at a point in time

- C1.168 If an NPO does not transfer control of a distinct good or service over time, the NPO transfers control of the good or service at a point in time and therefore fulfils a promise at a point in time.

- C1.169 For each promise an NPO fulfils at a point in time, the NPO shall recognise revenue at the specific point in time a customer obtains control of the distinct good or service. To identify this point in time, an NPO shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include:

- (a) the NPO having a present right to payment for the asset;

- (b) the customer having legal title to the asset;

- (c) the customer having physical possession of the asset;

- (d) the customer having the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset; and

- (e) the customer having accepted the asset (see paragraphs C1.171–C1.172).

- C1.170 The indicators in paragraph C1.169 are not always conclusive. Consequently, the absence of an indicator would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an asset. If it is clear from other features of the transaction that the customer has the present ability to direct the use of the asset and obtain the economic benefits that might flow from it, the customer has obtained control of the asset.

Customer acceptance

- C1.171 Customer acceptance clauses allow a customer to cancel a contract or require an NPO to take remedial action if a good or service does not meet agreed-upon specifications.

- If a contract includes a customer acceptance clause and the NPO cannot identify whether a good or service meets the agreed-upon specifications based on the information available to the NPO, it shall wait until it receives the customer’s acceptance before it concludes that the customer has obtained control of the good or service.

Measuring progress towards fulfilment of a promise

- C1.173 For each promise fulfilled over time in accordance with paragraphs C1.165–C1.167, an NPO shall calculate how much revenue to recognise in each reporting period by measuring its progress towards fulfilment of that promise at the end of the period.

- C1.174 An NPO shall choose a method of measuring progress that depicts the NPO’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to the customer. An NPO shall apply one method of measuring progress for each promise fulfilled over time and shall apply that method consistently to similar promises and in similar circumstances.

- C1.175 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall remeasure its progress towards fulfilment of a promise to reflect any changes in circumstances. The NPO shall account for changes to the measure of progress as a change in accounting estimate in accordance with B7 accounting policies, estimates and errors.

- C1.176 When choosing which method to use to measure its progress, an NPO shall consider the nature of the good or service it will transfer to a customer. Appropriate methods of measuring progress include methods that recognise revenue based on:

- (a) the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services to be transferred under the contract (‘output methods’); and

- (b) the NPO’s efforts or inputs to fulfil a promise relative to the total expected inputs to fulfil the promise (‘input methods’).

- C1.177 Common methods, and circumstances in which they might be appropriate, include:

- (a) an output method based on surveys of completed work, if the surveys give an objective measure of an NPO’s performance to date;

- (b) an output method based on units delivered, if each item transfers an equal amount of value to the customer on delivery;

- (c) an output method based on time elapsed, if control of the goods or services is transferred evenly over time;

- (d) an input method based on time elapsed, if an NPO’s efforts or inputs are spent evenly throughout the performance period;

- (e) an input method based on labour hours spent, if the labour hours spent and the transfer of control of goods or services to the customer are related; and

- (f) an input method based on costs incurred, excluding costs that do not contribute, or are not proportionate, to the NPO’s progress towards fulfilment of the promise (for example, inefficiencies and wasted or uninstalled materials).

- If an NPO has a right to consideration from the customer in an amount that relates directly to the value to the customer of the NPO’s work to date (for example, a service contract in which an NPO bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the NPO is permitted to recognise revenue in the amount it has a right to invoice.

Contract costs

Costs to obtain a contract

- C1.179 An NPO shall recognise costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as an expense when incurred, unless another section of this Standard requires the costs to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset.

Costs to fulfil a contract

- C1.180 An NPO shall account for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a customer in accordance with the relevant section of this Standard for those costs (for example, E1, E2 or E4).

- C1.181 If the costs incurred to fulfil a contract are not within the scope of another section of this Standard, an NPO shall recognise those costs as an asset if:

- (a) the costs relate directly to a contract (including future contracts) that the NPO can specifically identify (for example, costs relating to a specific contract that has not yet been approved) (see paragraph C1.182);

- (b) the costs create or improve the NPO’s resources that it will use to fulfil (or continue to fulfil) promises in the future; and

- (c) the NPO expects to recover the costs.

- C1.182 Costs that relate directly to a contract include direct labour, direct materials and allocations of costs that relate directly to the contract or contract activities.

- C1.183 General and administrative costs do not normally satisfy the criteria in paragraph C1.181, and are therefore recognised as expenses when incurred.

- C1.184 An NPO shall recognise costs that relate to promises that are fulfilled (or partially fulfilled) as expenses when incurred, because those costs relate to past performance.

Measurement after recognition

- C1.185 After initial recognition, an NPO shall measure assets arising from the costs to fulfil a contract in accordance with paragraph C1.181 at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses:

- (a) an NPO shall amortise the asset based on the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to which the asset relates.

- (b) an NPO shall follow E5 Impairment of assets to recognise and measure the impairment of the asset. However, the NPO shall apply paragraphs C1.186–C1.187 instead of paragraphs E5.13–E5.22 to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset.

- C1.186 For the purpose of measuring impairment losses, the recoverable amount of an asset arising from the costs to fulfil a contract is:

- (b) the remaining costs of providing those goods or services not yet incurred.

- C1.187 In measuring the remaining amount of consideration, the amount shall only include consideration for which collection is probable.

Contract balances

- C1.188 When either party to a contract has performed, an NPO shall present the contract in the Statement of Financial Position as either a contract asset or a contract liability based on the contract as a whole. The presentation of the contract balance depends on the relationship between:

- (a) the NPO’s performance in transferring the goods or services promised in the contract to the customer; and

- (b) the customer’s payment.

- C1.189 If an NPO has received consideration (or has a trade receivable) before it transfers goods or services to the customer, the NPO shall recognise a contract liability when the payment is made or due, whichever is earlier. A contract liability is an NPO’s obligation to transfer goods or services to the customer for which the NPO has received consideration (or for which the amount is due) from the customer. When (or as) the NPO transfers those goods or services to the customer, the NPO shall derecognise the contract liability (or part of a contract liability) and recognise revenue, in accordance with Step 5.

- If an NPO transfers goods or services to a customer before the customer has paid (or before payment is due), the NPO has a right to consideration. The NPO shall present that right as a contract asset, excluding any amounts presented as a trade receivable (see paragraph C1.191). An NPO shall assess a contract asset for impairment and recognise and measure any impairment loss in accordance with F1.

- C1.191 A receivable is an NPO’s unconditional right to consideration. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is necessary before payment of that consideration becomes due. An NPO can have an unconditional right to consideration even though it might be required to refund the consideration in the future (for example, when a right of return exists). In those instances, the NPO might recognise a trade receivable and a refund liability. An NPO shall account for a trade receivable in accordance with F1. An NPO shall present trade receivables separately from contract assets and contract liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position.

- C1.192 An NPO is permitted to use different descriptions in the Statement of Financial Position for ‘contract assets’ and ‘contract liabilities’. If an NPO uses a different description for ‘contract assets’, the NPO shall provide enough information for a user of the financial statements to distinguish between trade receivables and contract assets.

Disclosures

- C1.193 An NPO shall disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers using categories based on the characteristics of the NPO’s revenue, contracts or customers that are relevant to an understanding of its financial performance. Examples of categories that might be appropriate include:

- (a) type of good or service (for example, major product lines);

- (b) geographical region (for example, country or region);

- (c) market or type of customer (for example, government and non-government customers);

- (d) type of contract (for example, fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts);

- (e) contract duration (for example, short-term and long-term contracts);

- (f) timing of transfer of goods or services (for example, revenue from goods or services transferred to customers at a point in time and revenue from goods or services transferred over time); and

- (g) nature of promise (for example, revenue from acting as a principal and revenue from acting as an agent).

- C1.194 If not otherwise separately presented or disclosed, an NPO shall disclose:

- (a) the opening and closing balances of trade receivables and contract assets separately; and

- (b) total impairment losses recognised on trade receivables and contract assets during the reporting period in accordance with F1.

- C1.195 An NPO shall disclose:

- (a) the opening and closing balances of contract liabilities, if they are not otherwise separately presented or disclosed; and

- (b) revenue recognised in the reporting period that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.

- C1.196 An NPO shall disclose information about its promises in contracts with customers, including a description of:

- (a) when the NPO typically fulfils its promises (for example, upon shipment, upon delivery, as services are rendered or upon completion of service);

- (b) the main payment terms (for example, when payment is typically due, whether the contract constitutes a financing transaction, and whether the consideration includes a variable amount);

- (c) the nature of the goods or services that the NPO has promised to transfer to customers, highlighting any promises to arrange for another party to transfer goods or services (if the NPO is an agent);

- (d) obligations for returns, refunds and other similar obligations; and

- (e) types of warranties and related obligations.

- C1.197 An NPO shall disclose the methods it used to measure its progress towards fulfilment of promises fulfilled over time (for example, a description of the output methods or input methods used and how those methods were applied).

- C1.198 An NPO shall disclose any judgements it has made that had a significant effect on the amounts it recognised in its financial statements when:

- (a) determining the transaction price; and

- (b) allocating the transaction price to the promises identified in the contract.

- C1.199 An NPO shall disclose the closing balance of assets arising from the costs to fulfil a contract (in accordance with paragraph C1.181) by main category of asset (for example, pre-contract costs and set-up costs).

- C1.200 If an NPO chooses to use the option in paragraph C1.149 not to account for interest revenue separately from revenue from contracts with customers, it shall disclose that fact.

- If an NPO cannot account for an option to acquire additional goods or services that meets the criteria in paragraph AC1.13(a) as a separate promise without undue cost or effort, the NPO shall disclose that fact and the reasons why accounting for the option as a separate promise would involve undue cost or effort.

Application Guidance C1 – Revenue

Revenue from transactions with delivery obligations

Applying guidance in Part II to delivery obligations

- AC1.1 Part I and Part II of C1 both use the same 5-step model. Part I specifies the requirements for a simplified version of the 5-step model that is expected to apply to most delivery obligations. When a delivery obligation includes more complex arrangements, the NPO will apply the relevant guidance from Part II (see paragraph C1.69).

- AC1.2 Part I and Part II use different terminology when applying the 5-step model, as set out in paragraph C1.15. Other key differences are:

- (a) the 5-step model only applies to grant agreements that have delivery obligations, but applies to all contracts with customers; and

- (b) the term ‘delivery obligations’ (in a grant agreement) has a wider meaning than the term ‘promises’ (in a contract with customers). A promise in a contract with a customer always involves the NPO transferring goods and services to the purchaser (or an entity or individual specified by the purchaser). A delivery obligation might involve an NPO transferring goods or services but can also involve objectives to be achieved or activities to be carried out by the NPO that do not involve the transfer of goods or services to another party.

- AC1.3 In applying the requirements of Part II to a delivery obligation:

- (a) references to the ‘contract’ are to be read as the ‘grant agreement’;

- references to ‘promises’ are to be read as ‘delivery obligations’;

- (c) references to ‘goods or services transferred/to be transferred’ are to be read as ‘delivery obligations fulfilled/to be fulfilled’;

- (d) references to ‘customer’ are to be read as ‘grantor’;

- references to ‘transaction price’ are to be read as ‘transaction amount’; and

- (f) references to ‘consideration’ are to be read as the ‘grant’ or ‘grant amount’.

- AC1.4 The following table provides additional guidance on how an NPO should apply the Part II requirements to a Part I delivery obligation.

| Topic | Application to grant agreements/delivery obligations |
| --- | --- |
| (a) Criteria to be met before accounting for a grant agreement (paragraphs | | These paragraphs specify criteria that an NPO can apply to determine whether a grant agreement is within the scope of Part | if the NPO is uncertain about this. |
| C1.118-C1.123) | In applying the guidance, references to ‘commercial substance’ are to be read as ‘economic substance’. An NPO should assume that the grant agreement will have economic substance, as the risk, timing or amount of the NPO's future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the grant agreement. |
| (b) Combination of grant agreements (paragraph C1.125) | If an NPO has entered into two or more grant agreements with the same grantor at or near the same time, an NPO may apply this paragraph in determining whether the grant agreements should be combined. In applying this guidance, the reference to ‘price’ should be read as the ‘grant amounts allocated to delivery obligations within a grant agreement’. |
| (c) Modifications to grant agreements (paragraphs ACT.6-ACT.8) | An NPO shall apply these paragraphs if the terms of the grant agreement are changed. In applying this guidance, the reference to ‘stand-alone selling price’ shall be read as the ‘stand-alone value’. |
| (d) Variable grant amounts (paragraphs C1.137-C1.142) | An NPO shall apply these paragraphs if the amount of the grant | contains a variable element (for example, if an NPO receives a grant to carry out a vaccination programme, and an additional amount will be paid if the number of people vaccinated exceeds a defined |

| (e) Time value of money (paragraphs C1.147-C1.149) | An NPO shall apply these paragraphs where the time difference between the grant being paid and the delivery obligation being fulfilled is more than one year. In applying this guidance, an NPO shall allow for grants being paid in advance as well as after the delivery obligation is fulfilled, which can |
| (f) Non-cash grant amounts (paragraphs AC1.18-AC1.19) | give rise to an interest expense. An NPO shall apply this paragraph in measuring any non-cash grant amounts it receives for fulfilling a delivery obligation. Where an NPO cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non- cash item, it shall measure the non-cash grant amount indirectly by reference to the estimated cost of fulfilling the delivery obligations |
|  | or which the non-cash grant amount has been provided. |
| (g) Allocation of variable grant amounts (paragraphs C1.157- C1.159) | Where an NPO has identified variable grant amounts by applying the guidance in paragraphs C1.137-C1.142, it shall apply these paragraphs in allocating the variable grant amounts to delivery obligations. |
| (h) Delivery obligations fulfilled over time or at a point in time (paragraphs C1.160-C1.170) | Guidance in determining whether a delivery obligation to transfer goods or services is fulfilled over time or at a point in time can be ound in paragraphs C1.160-C1.170. Additional guidance for other types of delivery obligation can be ound in paragraphs C1.87-C1.88. |
| (i) Measuring progress towards complete fulfilment of a delivery obligation (paragraphs C1.173-C1.178) | For delivery obligations fulfilled over time, an NPO may apply the guidance in these paragraphs in selecting an appropriate method of measuring progress towards complete fulfilment of a delivery obligation. n applying these paragraphs, references to ‘value to the customer’ are to be read as ‘proportion of the activities undertaken’ or ‘cost of the goods or services provided’ as appropriate. |


Contracts with customers

- AC1.5 This guidance focuses on features found in some contracts with customers. The guidance covers:

- (a) contract modifications (see paragraphs AC1.6–AC1.8);

- (b) warranties (see paragraphs AC1.9–AC1.11);

- (c) customer options for additional goods or services (see paragraphs AC1.12–AC1.17);

- (d) non-cash consideration (see paragraphs AC1.18–AC1.19);

- (e) sale with a right of return (see paragraphs AC1.20–AC1.24); and

- (f) licensing (see paragraphs AC1.25–AC1.34).

Contract modifications

- AC1.6 A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that the parties to the contract approve. A contract modification either changes the existing rights and obligations in a contract or creates new ones.

- An NPO shall account for a contract modification as a separate contract if:

- (a) additional goods or services are promised that are distinct from those in the original contract; and

- (b) the price of the original contract increases by an amount that reflects the stand-alone selling price of the additional goods or services and any appropriate change to that price to reflect the circumstances of the modified contract.

- AC1.8 For a contract modification that is not a separate contract in accordance with paragraph AC1.7, an NPO shall account for the contract modification in one of two ways. If the goods or services an NPO will transfer after the contract modification are:

- (a) distinct from the goods or services the NPO has transferred before the contract modification, the NPO shall account for the contract modification as if the original contract had been cancelled and a new contract created. The transaction price for the new contract is the sum of:

- (i) the consideration included in the estimate of the transaction price for the original contract that the NPO did not recognise as revenue; and

- (ii) any increase or decrease in consideration promised as part of the contract modification.

- (b) not distinct from the goods or services the NPO has transferred before the contract modification, the NPO shall account for the contract modification as if it had always been part of the original contract. The NPO shall recognise the change in the transaction price and the NPO’s measure of progress towards fulfilment of the promise as an adjustment to revenue at the date of the contract modification (that is, on a cumulative catch- up basis).

Warranties

- AC1.9 An NPO might sell a good or service with a warranty.

- AC1.10 If a customer can choose to buy the good or service either with or without a warranty, the warranty is distinct. In these circumstances, an NPO shall account for the warranty as a separate promise and allocate a portion of the transaction price to that promise.

- AC1.11 If the customer has no option to buy the good or service without a warranty, the warranty is not distinct. In these circumstances, an NPO shall account for the warranty obligation in accordance with D5 Provisions and contingencies.

Customer options for additional goods or services

- AC1.12 An NPO might grant customers the option to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. Such options include sales incentives, customer award credits (or points), contract renewal options or other discounts on future goods or services.

- AC1.13 An NPO shall account for an option to acquire additional goods or services as a separate promise if:

- (a) the option gives the customer a material right that:

- (i) is only available to a customer that has entered into that contract; and

- (ii) allows a customer to acquire an additional good or service at a discount to their stand-alone selling price; and

- (b) the option can be accounted for as a separate promise without undue cost or effort.

- AC1.14 To account for the option as a separate promise, the NPO shall:

- (a) allocate a portion of the transaction price to the promise (see paragraph AC1.15–AC1.17); and

- (b) recognise revenue when the NPO transfers those future goods or services or when the option expires.

- AC1.15 In accordance with Step 4, an NPO shall allocate the transaction price to each promise in the contract on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, an NPO shall estimate the price. The estimate of the stand-alone selling price of an option shall reflect the discount that the customer would obtain when exercising the option, adjusted for both:

- (a) any discount that the customer could receive without exercising the option; and

- the likelihood that the customer will exercise the option.

- AC1.16 An NPO might grant a customer an option to renew a contract on similar terms. If the NPO accounts for the renewal option as a separate promise, it shall allocate the transaction price to the option based on the total expected consideration allocated to the total goods or services it expects to transfer, instead of estimating the stand-alone selling price of the option. The NPO shall include expected renewal period(s) when estimating the total goods or services it expects to transfer and corresponding total expected consideration.

- AC1.17 The amount of the transaction price allocated to the renewal option is the difference between:

- (a) the transaction price for the original contract; and

- (b) the amount of the total expected consideration allocated to the goods or services to be transferred under the original contract.

Non-cash consideration

- AC1.18 The consideration promised by a customer might be in a form other than cash, such as goods or services. An example is an exchange of goods in a barter transaction.

- AC1.19 An NPO shall measure the non-cash consideration at fair value unless the fair value cannot be reasonably estimated. If an NPO cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non- cash consideration, the NPO shall instead measure the consideration based on the stand- alone selling price of the goods or services promised to the customer in exchange for the consideration.

Sale with a right of return

- AC1.20 An NPO might sell a product and give the customer the right to return the product in exchange for any combination of:

- (a) a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;

- (b) a credit that can be applied against amounts owed, or that will be owed, to the NPO; and (c) another product.

- To account for products sold with a right of return, an NPO shall recognise:

- (a) revenue for consideration received or receivable for transferred products the NPO expects not to be returned;

- (b) a refund liability for transferred products the NPO expects to be returned; and

- (c) a returns asset for transferred products the NPO expects to be returned (and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales) classified as inventory and measured in accordance with paragraphs AC1.23–AC1.24.

- AC1.22 Products an NPO expects to be returned shall exclude:

- (a) products expected to be returned and exchanged for another of the same type, quality, condition and price (for example, one colour or size for another); and

- (b) defective products expected to be returned and exchanged for functioning products.

- AC1.23 An NPO shall initially measure the returns asset at the former carrying amount of the products the NPO expects to be returned minus:

- (a) any expected costs to recover those products; and

- (b) any allowances for possible decreases in the value of those products (for example, because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling prices).

- AC1.24 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall adjust the refund liability and returns asset for changes in its expectations about products to be returned. The NPO shall recognise adjustments to:

- (a) the refund liability in revenue; and

- the returns asset as an expense.

Licensing

- AC1.25 A licence gives a customer rights to an NPO’s intellectual property (such as software, technology, trademarks, patents, franchises, music and motion picture films).

- AC1.26 If a contract with a customer includes a licence (or licences) and other goods or services, an NPO shall apply Step 2 to identify each of the promises in the contract. If the licence is not distinct from the other goods or services in the contract, an NPO shall apply Step 5 to determine whether the promise to grant the licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time. If the licence is distinct from the other goods or services in the contract, an NPO shall apply paragraphs AC1.27–AC1.33 to determine whether the promise to grant the licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time.

- AC1.27 To determine if the promise to grant a licence is fulfilled over time or at a point in time, an NPO shall consider whether the licence gives the customer either:

- (a) a right to access the NPO’s intellectual property as it exists throughout the licence period, and in which case the NPO fulfils the promise (and recognises revenue) over time; or

- (b) a right to use the NPO’s intellectual property as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted, in which case the NPO fulfils the promise (and recognises revenue) at a point in time.

- AC1.28 A licence gives a customer a right to access an NPO’s intellectual property if the NPO expects to undertake activities:

- (a) that will substantively affect the customer’s benefit from the intellectual property by changing the intellectual property’s substance (see paragraph AC1.30); or

- (b) that could substantively affect the customer’s benefit from the intellectual property by directly exposing the customer to any positive or negative effects of those activities (see paragraph AC1.31).

- AC1.29 An NPO’s expected activities might be included in the terms of a contract or might be activities that a customer reasonably expects the NPO will undertake. For the purpose of applying the criteria in paragraph AC1.28, the NPO shall exclude activities that result in the transfer of a good or service to the customer.

- AC1.30 Activities undertaken by the NPO that change the intellectual property’s substance include activities that change the intellectual property’s design, content or ability to do a function or task (for example, development activities that change the content to which the customer has rights).

- AC1.31 Activities undertaken by the entity that directly expose the customer to positive or negative effects include activities that support or maintain the value of intellectual property (for example, ongoing activities that maintain the value of the brand to which the customer has rights).

- AC1.32 If either criterion in paragraph AC1.28 is met, the promise to grant a licence is fulfilled over time. Otherwise, the promise is fulfilled at a point in time.

- AC1.33 If a promise to grant a licence is fulfilled over time, an NPO shall apply paragraphs C1.173–C1.178 to choose an appropriate method to measure its progress towards fulfilment of that promise. If a promise to grant a licence is fulfilled at a point in time, an NPO shall apply paragraphs C1.168–C1.172 to identify the point in time the licence transfers to the customer, which cannot be before the customer is able use and benefit from the licence.

- AC1.34 An NPO might grant a licence of intellectual property in exchange for a royalty based on sales or use. If the licence is the sole or main item to which the royalty relates, the NPO shall recognise revenue for such a royalty when (or as) the later of two events happens:

- (a) the promise to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been fulfilled (or partially fulfilled); or

- (b) the subsequent sale or use takes place.

D1 – Classification of expenses

Scope of this Section

- D1.1 This Section specifies the requirements for an analysis of expenses that an NPO shall present in accordance with paragraph B3.11.

Classification methods

- D1.2 An NPO shall provide an analysis of expenses using a classification method based on either the nature of expenses, the function of expenses within the NPO or a mixed presentation (with part by nature of expenses classification and part by function of expenses classification), whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant to the users of the financial statements. This analysis shall be presented in the Statement of Income and Expenses.

- D1.3 There is a rebuttable presumption that the reliable and most relevant information to users will be provided by an analysis of expenses based on the nature of expenses classification. If the presumption is rebutted and a classification based on the function of expenses within the NPO or a mixed presentation is used, disclosure shall be made in accordance with D1.12.

Analysis by nature of expense

- The analysis of expenses by nature provides information about expenses arising from the economic resources (inputs) that are consumed to accomplish an NPO’s activities. Using this classification, expenses are aggregated in the Statement of Income and Expenses according to their nature or type (for example, employee benefits, travel and subsistence, supplies and materials, external services) without reference to how expenses are allocated to functions or activities within the NPO.

Analysis by function of expense

- The analysis of expenses by function allocates and aggregates expenses according to the activity to which the item relates. For example, the costs of distributing humanitarian aid could be a by-function line item that combines employee benefits, travel and subsistence, supplies and materials, and external services related to that activity. Other by-function line items could include major operational programmes or administrative support activities, whatever is most relevant to the NPO.

Analysis by mixed presentation

- D1.6 The mixed presentation combines analysis by nature and analysis by function. Under this classification, expenses are aggregated in the Statement of Income and Expenses partly according to their nature and partly according to their function.

Determining which analysis of expenses is reliable and

- D1.7 In determining whether to rebut the presumption in accordance with paragraph D1.3, an NPO shall consider:

- (a) which analysis provides reliable and the most relevant information to users of the financial statements about key components of the NPO’s surplus or deficit;

- (b) which analysis most closely represents the way the NPO is managed and how its management reports internally;

- (c) sector practice – the use of similar analyses of expenses would enable users of the general purpose financial statements to more easily compare expenses across entities in the same sector;

- (d) whether the allocation of expenses to functions would be arbitrary and therefore would not provide a sufficiently faithful representation of the line items presented. In such cases, an NPO shall classify these expenses by nature.

- Paragraph D1.14(a) requires an NPO to provide a narrative description of the types of expenses (based on their nature) that contribute to the total costs of each functional line item. This will include, for example, employee benefits, supplies and materials and depreciation.

Allocation and aggregation of expenses

- Analysis by function of expense and analysis using a mixed presentation involves the allocation, apportionment and aggregation of some or all expenses to the function to which the consumed resource relates. An NPO shall ensure that the methods of allocating, apportioning and aggregating expenses are reasonable and consistently applied and consistent between reporting periods unless circumstances change. An NPO shall select a method that ensures that the accounts provide a relevant and faithful representation of the costs of each function.

- D1.10 Where expenses are allocated to functions, an NPO shall apply the following general principles:

- (a) direct costs – these are expenses which are directly attributable to a single function. Direct costs shall be allocated directly to that function. For example, the employee costs of an individual employed on a single function or the cost of running a vehicle used wholly for a single function;

- (b) shared costs – these are also direct expenses that can also be described as direct shared costs. These costs are directly attributable to more than one function. Shared costs shall be allocated between the functions that directly use the resources, based on usage. For example, the employee costs for a staff member whose time is divided between fundraising and the delivery of a programme would be allocated between those functions based on the time spent on each;

- (c) support costs – these are expenses that are organisation-wide. Support costs can either be:

- (i) apportioned between the functions being supported; or

- (ii) presented as a separate function.

Support costs are not expenses that can be directly attributed or allocated to a function. An additional process is required to determine how such costs are apportioned in accordance with (i). An NPO may decide that support costs are a separate function in accordance with (ii).

- D1.11 Where an NPO apportions support costs to functions in accordance with paragraph D1.10(c)(i), an apportionment basis shall be selected that is relevant and that most faithfully represents the use of the components that comprise support costs.

Disclosures

- D1.12 Where an NPO decides to rebut the presumption in accordance with paragraph D1.3, it shall provide an explanation as to why the analysis chosen provides information that is reliable and more relevant to the users of the general purpose financial statements.

- D1.13 Where an NPO uses a mixed presentation in the Statement of Income and Expenses, it shall label the line items in such a way that clearly identifies what expenses are in each line item. For example, if an NPO includes employee benefits in a function item for aid programmes but also presents other employee benefits as a separate line item, the NPO will need to clearly identify that the employee benefits line item does not include all employee benefits.

- D1.14 Where an NPO has classified expenses by function or used a mixed presentation it shall disclose:

- (a) a narrative description of what types of expenses (based on their nature) are included in each by function line item.

- (b) the basis used to allocate shared costs and to apportion support costs.

- D1.15 An NPO shall disclose the following information, if not already presented in an analysis of expenses in the Statement of Income and Expenses, or otherwise disclosed in the general purpose financial statements:

- (a) benefits received by volunteers; and

- (b) losses, write-offs and unusual payments.

Benefits received by volunteers

- D1.16 Where volunteers are part of key management personnel, these benefits shall be separately disclosed as per paragraph H1.6 of Section H1 Related party disclosures.

- D1.17 Where volunteers receive benefits (volunteer benefits) such as free or subsidised services or goods, these shall be disclosed separately from employee benefit disclosures required by D4 Employee benefits. Where volunteer benefits are provided on the same basis as to an NPO’s employees they are not required to be disclosed, unless they are a substitute for remuneration.

- D1.18 Where the volunteer is a recipient of services made in accordance with the NPO’s primary purpose and these services are provided on the same terms as other eligible service recipients, an NPO is not required to disclose the amount of these volunteer benefits.

Losses, write-offs and unusual payments

- D1.19 Losses, write-offs and unusual payments relate to a range of expenses that are outside of the normal activities of an NPO. Given the differing nature of NPOs’ activities, it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of the expenses that may be included in this disclosure. Judgement shall be applied by an NPO to determine whether the substance of an expense means it should be disclosed.

- D1.20 Losses and write-offs include expenses arising from cash losses, unrecoverable overpayments, losses from fraud, theft, arson or other deliberate acts, payments for which a liability should not have been incurred, constructive losses, claims waived or abandoned and similar items.

- D1.21 Unusual payments include extra-contractual payments, payments to contractors outside of a binding contract, compensation payments, special severance payments and payments that

those charged with governance of the NPO have no legal obligation or legal power to make but which they believe they have a moral obligation to make.

- D1.22 An NPO shall disclose details of losses, write-offs and unusual payments made including those where the NPO has been required to obtain authority to make payments from a court, regulator or similar body. Where this does not impact on the understandability of the information provided an NPO may aggregate losses, write-offs and unusual payments of a similar nature. For each loss, write-off or unusual payment (or aggregation) the notes to the accounts shall state the amount and provide an explanation of the nature of the loss, write-off or unusual payment and the reason why it occurred.

D2 – Expenses on grants and donations

Scope of this Section

- This Section specifies the accounting for expenses on grants, donations and similar transfers (hereafter called grant expenses) by grantors. It does not relate to the receipt of grants, donations and similar transfers from another entity as a grant recipient. C1 Part I Revenue from grants and donations addresses these transactions.

- D2.2 This Section is drafted from the perspective of an NPO that provides resources to grant recipients and is also the reporting NPO in accordance with A2 Concepts and pervasive principles. The NPO is described in this Section as the grantor.

- D2.3 A grant expense is an expense arising from a transaction in which a grantor provides, or is obliged to provide, resources to a grant recipient (which may be an entity or an individual) by transferring cash or a service, good or other asset to that grant recipient without directly receiving any cash, service, good or other asset in return.

Types of grant expenses

- D2.4 Grant expenses may arise from grant agreements or from the transfer of resources where there is not a grant agreement (for example a donation). Grant agreements may give the grantor fulfilment rights. Grant agreements may include components with fulfilment rights and those without fulfilment rights.

- D2.5 Fulfilment rights are a grantor’s enforceable right to have the grant recipient satisfy its delivery obligation in a manner specified in the grant agreement or be required to address the consequences specified in the agreement. This Section uses the term ‘extinguish’ when (or as) a grantor no longer has enforceable rights in a grant transaction or agreement. This will include when the grant recipient has satisfied its delivery obligation.

- D2.6 Grant expense transactions without fulfilment rights may give rise to a constructive obligation for the grantor – see D5 Provisions and contingencies.

- D2.7 Figure D2.1 below summarises the process for recognition and presentation of grant expenses:

Figure D2.1: Decision tree illustrating the recognition and presentation of grant expenses

Recognition Phase

First, determine if the expense arises from an agreement.

If the expense does NOT arise from an agreement, then ask if the grantor has acted in a way that could give rise to a valid expectation.

If NO, the outcome is to recognise the expense when the grantor ceases to control the resource.
If YES, the outcome is to apply D5 Provisions and contingencies.
If the expense DOES arise from an agreement, then ask if there is more than one component to the agreement.

If YES, you must apply the following steps to each component.
If NO (or for each individual component), then ask if the agreement or component includes a fulfilment right.
If NO, the outcome is to recognise the expense when the grantor ceases to control the resource.
If YES, the outcome is to recognise the expense when (or as) the fulfilment right is extinguished.
Presentation Phase

After the recognition step is complete, the final presentation step is to present the expense in an unrestricted fund.

The only exception is if the expense has been incurred as a result of a grant agreement where that agreement is presented as part of a restricted fund in accordance with B8 Fund accounting. In this specific case, the grant expense will be shown against the relevant restricted fund.

Footnotes:

- 1 A grantor shall consider whether the substance of any transactions (for example, a match funding requirement) aﬀects the point at which it loses control of a resource.

- 2 A grantor shall consider whether the substance of any grant agreement terms (for example, a requirement to obtain regulatory approval) aﬀects the timing of when the grantor’s right is extinguished or its obligation to transfer a resource arises.

Grant expenses transactions without fulfilment rights

- A grant agreement with a grant recipient that is not enforceable through legal or equivalent means and does not give both parties rights is a grant expense transaction without fulfilment rights. A grant expense transaction without fulfilment rights may be a written agreement, an oral agreement or implied by customary practices.

- A grant expense transaction without fulfilment rights may constrain how a grant recipient uses the resources transferred to it even where the rights and obligations in the grant agreement do not create a delivery obligation for the grant recipient.

- D2.10 A grant expense transaction without fulfilment rights also includes those situations where a grantor transfers resources to a grant recipient without there being any agreed or implied agreement in place.

Grant expenses transactions with fulfilment rights

- D2.11 Fulfilment rights arise from grant agreements that confer both rights and obligations, enforceable through legal or equivalent means, on both the parties to the agreement. This could be through a written grant agreement but could also be through an oral agreement or implied by customary practices.

- D2.12 In determining whether a grant agreement includes enforceable rights and obligations, a grantor shall consider the substance rather than the legal form of the grant agreement. This will require the consideration of the grantor’s, the grant recipient’s and the sector’s customary practices.

- D2.13 A grant expense transaction with fulfilment rights exists where a grant agreement separately identifies:

- (a) specified outcomes that the grant recipient undertakes to achieve with the transferred resources;

- (b) specified activities that the grant recipient undertakes to carry out with the transferred resources; or

- (c) distinct services, goods and other assets that the grant recipient undertakes to use the resources for, either internally or to transfer externally.

Such requirements on the use of the resources create a delivery obligation for the grant recipient.

Enforceability

- D2.14 To be a grant expense transaction with fulfilment rights, the interdependent rights and obligations in the grant agreement must be enforceable. This means that the grantor can require the grant recipient to complete the agreed obligations or be subject to remedies for not doing so, and the grant recipient is able to require the grantor to transfer the amount agreed. A grant expense transaction with fulfilment rights will exist if there is the ability to exercise these rights, even if in practice they are never or rarely used.

- D2.15 Enforceability can arise from various mechanisms (see paragraphs C1.45–C1.55). This includes enforceability through “legal and equivalent means”. While enforceability usually applies to a grant agreement as a whole, there may be some agreements where enforceability applies to an individual grant expense transaction.

- D2.16 The enforcement mechanism should establish:

- (a) the right of the grantor to require the grant recipient to complete the agreed obligation or be subject to remedies for non-completion; and

- (b) the right of the grant recipient to require the grantor to transfer the agreed consideration.

- D2.17 The grantor’s assessment of enforceability occurs at the inception of the grant agreement and subsequently when a significant external change indicates that there may be a change in the enforceability of that agreement.

- D2.18 A general statement of intent by a grantor that it may transfer cash or deliver goods, services or other assets in a certain way is not usually a grant agreement under which both parties have rights and obligations. It may, however, give rise to a constructive obligation in accordance with D5.7.

Accounting for grant expense transactions

Grant expenses from transactions without fulfilment rights

Recognition and measurement

- D2.19 For grant expense transactions without fulfilment rights, a grant expense shall be recognised when the grantor transfers the resources to the grant recipient and no longer controls the resources in the transaction.

- D2.20 Where there is an obligation to transfer resources that:

- (a) results in the recognition of a liability because of a legal or equivalent obligation (hereafter a legal obligation); or

- (b) a constructive obligation that results in the recognition of a provision in accordance with paragraph D5.5;

a grant expense shall be recognised at the same time as the liability or provision. The subsequent transfer of resources will settle the recognised liability or provision.

- D2.21 When a grant expense is recognised in accordance with paragraph D2.19 it shall be measured at the carrying amount of the previously controlled resources.

- D2.22 Where a grantor recognises a provision in accordance with paragraph D2.20, the liability is initially and subsequently measured in accordance with paragraphs D5.10–D5.14.

- D2.23 Where the grantor constrains the use of the resources provided to the grant recipient, if at a future date the grant recipient does not satisfy those requirements, this may give rise to an asset for the grantor. This is subject to any repayment or refund meeting the definition of an asset in A2. A grantor shall consider whether there is a possible asset whose existence is yet to be confirmed in accordance with paragraph D5.16.

- D2.24 The grantor will only recognise an asset where the failure to satisfy the requirements creates a present obligation for the grant recipient. For example, if a grant recipient fails to use a grant within the timeframe specified in the grant agreement, an obligation to refund all or part of the grant may arise at the end of the specified time period. Where a refund is disputed and being subject to mediation, a grantor shall consider whether a contingent asset should be disclosed.

- D2.25 After the inception of a grant agreement, a grantor shall account for any financial asset that arises because of a grant recipient’s failure to comply with the terms of the grant agreement. The financial asset shall be recognised and measured in accordance with F1 Financial instruments as at the date at which the failure to meet the requirement is confirmed. If it is not a financial asset, it is accounted for in accordance with the relevant section of INPAS. The asset shall subsequently be assessed for impairment in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets.

Grant expenses from grant expense transactions with fulfilment rights

Recognition and measurement

- D2.26 A grantor shall consider its rights in the grant agreement. The grantor shall identify each distinct fulfilment right (or series of fulfilment rights that have substantially similar characteristics) that creates a delivery obligation for the grant recipient.

- D2.27 The substance of the grant agreement may mean that effectively there is only one fulfilment right and one delivery obligation.

- D2.28 The grantor shall consider the terms of the grant agreement to determine the stand-alone amount that the agreement obliges it to pay the grant recipient for extinguishing each distinct fulfilment right. If there is only one fulfilment right, this will be the total amount of the grant.

- D2.29 A fulfilment right will be wholly unsatisfied if the grantor has not yet transferred resources, is not yet obligated to transfer resources to the grant recipient and the grant recipient has not yet met any of the delivery obligations in the grant agreement. This is similar to an executory contract in which neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations. If a fulfilment right is wholly unsatisfied, the grantor shall not recognise any expense, asset or liability associated with the grant agreement. Only as one or both parties begin to fulfil their obligations shall the grantor begin to recognise transactions associated with the grant agreement.

- D2.30 The grantor shall consider whether there are requirements attached to delivery obligations that enable it to realistically be able to avoid the transfer of resources. If the grantor concludes that it cannot realistically avoid the transfer of resources, the grantor shall recognise a liability, and a grant expense measured at the stand-alone amount of the distinct fulfilment right associated with the delivery obligation.

- D2.31 If the grantor concludes that there are requirements attached to delivery obligations that enable it to realistically avoid the transfer of resources, the recognition of assets, liabilities and expenses will commence only when one party to the grant agreement starts to meet the requirements related to their obligations under the agreement.

- D2.32 A grantor recognises a grant expense when a fulfilment right is extinguished. The grantor measures the grant expense at the stand-alone amount of the fulfilment right.

- D2.33 When a grantor transfers resources prior to the grant recipient satisfying its delivery obligation, the grantor shall recognise a prepayment asset and derecognise the transferred resources. The grantor measures the prepayment asset at the total carrying amount of the transferred resources. A grantor shall recognise the grant expense when the grant recipient satisfies the delivery obligation to which the fulfilment right relates (and the fulfilment right is extinguished) and derecognise the prepayment asset.

- D2.34 Conversely, when a grant recipient satisfies a delivery obligation prior to the grantor transferring resources, the grantor shall recognise a liability and a grant expense. The grantor shall measure the liability and grant expense at the total carrying amount of the resources the grant agreement requires the grantor to transfer to the grant recipient for extinguishing its fulfilment right. Where the obligation is to transfer cash, this will be a financial liability measured at amortised cost in accordance with paragraph F1.17.

Reclassification and impairment of a prepayment asset

- D2.35 Where a grantor recognises a prepayment asset in accordance with paragraph D2.33, the grant recipient may subsequently become unable or unwilling to satisfy its delivery obligations under the grant agreement. Where the grantor has an enforceable and unconditional right to a refund or return of the previously transferred resources arising from the terms of the grant agreement, the grantor shall reclassify the prepayment asset to a financial asset. Following its reclassification, the grantor shall measure the financial asset in accordance with F1.

- D2.36 If the grant prepayment asset is not reclassified to a financial asset as set out in paragraph D2.35 because the terms of the grant agreement, the legal system in the jurisdiction and/or other circumstances do not allow the recognition of a financial asset, the grantor shall assess the prepayment asset for impairment in accordance with E5.

Variable consideration

- D2.37 The amount that the grantor is obliged to transfer to the grant recipient may vary for items such as incentives, penalties or other similar items. It may also vary if the grantor’s obligation to provide the resources is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event. For example, an additional amount of funds may become payable to the grant recipient if the grant recipient meets its delivery obligations in the grant agreement within a specified period. This is known as variable consideration.

- D2.38 The variable consideration in a grant agreement may result in a liability of uncertain timing or amount that meets the definition of a provision in D5. If the grantor has determined that it is more likely than not that a present obligation exists for the payment of variable consideration, the grantor shall estimate an amount of variable consideration that is initially and subsequently measured in accordance with paragraphs D5.10–D5.14.

Changes to the amount that the grant agreement requires a grantor to transfer and modification of the fulfilment rights

- D2.39 After the inception of the grant agreement, the amount that a grant agreement requires a grantor to transfer to the grant recipient can change for various reasons, including the resolution of uncertain events or other changes in circumstances. Any changes to the amounts allocated to a previously extinguished fulfilment right shall be recognised as an additional expense, or as a reduction of an expense, in the period in which the amount that the grantor is obligated to transfer changes.

- D2.40 A modification of a grant agreement may occur through an approved change to the rights and obligations by the parties to the agreement. The grantor shall determine the accumulated grant expense to be recognised as at the date of the modification by revising its estimates of the amount it is obliged to transfer for each fulfilment right extinguished. The grantor shall also determine the amount allocated to those fulfilment rights that have been extinguished and those which have not. The grantor shall recognise the difference between the accumulated grant expense determined as at the date of the modification and the accumulated grant expense previously recognised in surplus or deficit as at the date of the modification.

- D2.41 A modification to a grant expense transaction with fulfilment rights may require the grantor to account for the modification as a separate transaction. A grantor shall account for a modification to a grant expense transaction as a separate transaction if both of the following factors are present:

- (a) the scope of the grant transaction increases, providing the grantor with one or more additional fulfilment rights, because the grant recipient accepts one or more additional delivery obligations or an increase in one or more existing delivery obligations; and

- (b) the grant payment consideration increases by an amount that is intended to reflect the value of the additional fulfilment rights by compensating the grant recipient for the additional or increased delivery obligations assumed.

Other obligations in grant agreements

- The transfer of resources by a grantor may require the grant recipient to obtain match funding (an amount specified in the grant agreement in order for the grantor to be obligated to make the grant). The grantor shall assess at each reporting date whether the transfer of resources is probable. Where the grantor determines that the transfer of resources is probable, it shall follow the requirements of paragraph D5.5, with any provision for grant expenses initially and subsequently measured in accordance with paragraphs D5.10–D5.14.

Payment of grants over more than one reporting period

- D2.43 If a fulfilment right spans multiple reporting periods, the grantor shall recognise both a liability and grant expense for the total amount of resources transferred to the grant recipient for the obligations satisfied where it has a present obligation to transfer resources at the reporting date.

- D2.44 When payments for later reporting periods are subject to the grant recipient satisfying delivery obligations that it has not yet met, the grantor shall not recognise a grant expense until the delivery obligations have been satisfied. The amount for each stand-alone fulfilment right shall be recognised in the period that the grant recipient satisfies the delivery obligation.

- D2.45 If the grant agreement provides the grantor with the discretion to avoid grant expenses, for example, when there are review or break clauses in the grant agreement, the grantor shall not recognise a liability as it does not have a present obligation to transfer resources. If the possibility of termination is clearly set out in the grant agreement, then a constructive obligation is unlikely to arise for payments related to periods after the review date.

- If the grantor cannot realistically avoid the transfer of resources relating to future periods, a grant payment liability and grant expense shall be recognised for the present value of the full grant payment amount, even if payment will occur over multiple reporting periods. When the amount is material, the NPO shall measure the full grant payment at its time adjusted value.

Capital grants

- D2.47 A grant agreement that requires the grant recipient to acquire or construct a non-current asset that the grant recipient will then control is a capital grant.

- D2.48 A grantor shall follow the same approach to recognising a grant expense involving a capital grant as with any other grant expenses as set out in D2.26–D2.34. The grantor shall derecognise the prepayment asset and recognise a grant expense, as the grant recipient constructs or acquires the non-current asset.

- If the grant recipient subsequently disposes of an acquired asset or constructed asset against the terms of the grant agreement, the grantor shall consider whether it has an enforceable unconditional right to a refund of the value of transferred resources and apply paragraphs D2.35–D2.36.

- D2.50 Such a right might indicate an agency relationship because the grantor retains control of the asset. If an agency relationship exists, the grantor shall not recognise the grant expense but recognise the construction or acquisition of its own non-current asset (see D2.53–D2.57).

Foreign exchange gains and losses

- D2.51 The terms of a grant agreement may require a grantor to recognise assets or liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency.

- D2.52 Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency during the reporting period or on their restatement at the reporting date shall be recognised in accordance with paragraphs A5.12–A5.14.

Principal versus agent considerations

- D2.53 An important question for the recognition and measurement of grant expenses is whether the grantor controls the economic resources at any point before it transfers them to the grant

recipient. A grantor controls the economic resources by having the present ability to direct the use of the economic resources and to obtain the economic benefits or service potential that may flow from them.

- D2.54 If the grantor controls the economic resources, it is a principal in the transaction, and the recognition and measurement requirements of paragraphs D2.8–D2.34 shall apply to grant expenses. This is the case even if the grantor is subject to a grant agreement with a grant recipient that imposes obligations upon the grantor. This is because as a principal the grantor will ultimately have discretion over the objectives in a grant agreement and the requirements under which the transaction is to occur, including the amounts and timing of the transaction and the selection of the grant recipient.

- D2.55 If a grantor does not control the economic resources at the point they are transferred, it is likely to be acting as an agent for another entity. This situation may occur, for example, when a grantor operates in a jurisdiction where another entity does not. By agreement, the grantor may administer the other entity’s funds and transfer the other entity’s funds to a grant recipient on its behalf. As an agent, the grantor will be acting for the other entity’s purpose and objectives, and in accordance with the instructions or directions of the other entity. It will have no discretion over the use to which the resources are put.

- D2.56 A grantor shall not recognise a grant expense in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of paragraphs D2.8–D2.34 where it is acting as an agent and is transferring cash or other assets to a grant recipient on behalf of another entity. Assets related to an agency arrangement such as funding provided to the grantor by the other entity to carry out its activities shall not form part of the grantor’s assets or income.

- Any income due to the grantor for administering the agency arrangement shall be recognised in accordance with C1 Revenue. A grantor shall recognise the costs incurred in the administration of the agency arrangement by the grantor as an expense. Funds that the grantor is holding as an agent will be presented and disclosed in accordance with paragraph D2.64.

Disclosures

- D2.58 A grantor shall disclose sufficient information to enable the users of the general purpose financial reports to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty arising from grant expenses.

- D2.59 A grantor shall disclose the following information on grant expenses both with and without fulfilment rights:

- (a) the purpose of the grants for which an NPO recognises grant expenses in the financial statements;

- (b) significant payment terms;

- (c) the nature of the resources that the grantor has or will transfer; and

- the existence and potential consequences of any variable consideration.

Analysis of grant expenses

- A grantor shall disclose the amount recognised in the Statement of Income and Expenses as grant expenses and provide an analysis of grant expenses. This disclosure shall provide an analysis aligned with the significant activities of the grantor. If disclosing information on grant expenses risks reporting sensitive information an NPO shall refer to paragraph A3.6.

Grant expenses made from a restricted fund

- D2.61 Where a grantor has financed a grant expense with revenue provided to it that it has classified to a restricted fund, the grant expense will be presented as a restricted grant expense in accordance with B8 Fund accounting.

Assets and liabilities

- D2.62 When a grantor has recognised a prepayment asset in accordance with paragraph D2.33, it shall present the prepayment asset separately in the Statement of Financial Position.

- An NPO shall follow the disclosure requirements in D5 for all grant commitments and liabilities. When a grantor has recognised a liability for an obligation other than cash, the grantor shall provide information on the nature of the obligation and the resources that will need to be transferred to satisfy the obligation. If the liability is an obligation to transfer cash, the disclosure requirements in F1 for payables are applicable.

Grantor as agent

- D2.64 Where a grantor has acted as an agent during the reporting period, it shall disclose in a note to the accounts:

- (a) an analysis of funds received and paid by the grantor as an agent;

- (b) details of any balances held as an agent at the reporting date;

- (c) the name and objects of the entity on whose behalf the balances are held and why the grantor is acting as an agent on their behalf;

- (d) details of any balances outstanding between any participating consortium members for which the grantor is administratively responsible;

- (e) where a grantor has held funds as an agent for related parties, it shall make the required disclosures for related parties; and

- (f) details of the arrangements for safe custody and segregation of funds and other assets from the grantor’s own assets.

D3 – Fundraising costs

Scope of this Section

- D3.1 This Section specifies the requirements for calculating and disclosing costs associated with fundraising activities. Fundraising costs shall be separately calculated and disclosed either in the Statement of Income and Expenses or in the notes to the financial statements, whichever expense analysis permissible under paragraph D1.2 is adopted by an NPO.

Fundraising activities

- Fundraising activities can be one of three distinct categories of activity. These are activities that an NPO carries out to generate funds for the provision of services and goods for the benefit of the public, carrying out programme and similar activities in pursuit of the NPO’s stated mission or objectives or supporting other activities.

- D3.3 The three categories of fundraising activities are:

- (a) donations, gifts, grants and similar transfers;

- (b) commercial and trading; and

- (c) investment management.

- D3.4 Fundraising activities shall not include the development of corporate documents applicable to the whole of an NPO’s activities such as business plans or annual reports.

Donations, gifts, grants and similar transfers

- D3.5 The donations, gifts, grants and similar transfers category of fundraising activities involves activities relating to requesting or obtaining present or future donations, gifts, grants and similar transfers of cash or non-cash assets from entities or individuals external to the NPO.

- D3.6 Fundraising costs in the donations, gifts, grants and similar transfers category include but are not limited to those costs incurred in:

- (a) seeking donations, grants and legacies including application costs;

- (b) researching and developing fundraising strategies and plans for approaching prospective donors;

- (c) operating membership schemes or social lotteries;

- (d) staging events, including performance fees, licence fees and other related costs;

- (e) contracting with agents to raise funds on behalf of the NPO; and

- (f) advertising, marketing and direct mail materials, but not costs associated with educational material designed to further an NPO’s mission.

Commercial and trading

- D3.7 The commercial and trading category of fundraising activities includes commercial and trading activities where an NPO aims to generate profits for use in achieving the NPO’s mission. Fundraising costs in this category include but are not limited to those costs incurred in:

- (a) operating a trading outlet to sell donated and/or bought-in goods; and

- (b) operating a trading company undertaking other commercial or trading activities.

- D3.8 Where an NPO makes a charge to partially cover the costs of services or goods provided to those intended to directly benefit from the NPO’s activities, and those charges are part of

the operating model established to meet an NPO’s mission or objectives, the costs of those activities are not fundraising costs.

- D3.9 Where an NPO holds an investment that it relies on to generate returns to be able to carry out its missional purposes, investment management is considered as a category of fundraising costs. Fundraising costs in the investment management category include but are not limited to those costs incurred in:

- (a) portfolio management;

- (b) obtaining investment advice;

- (c) administration of the investments;

- (d) costs of licensing intellectual property; and

- (e) rent collection, property repairs and maintenance charges for investment property.

- D3.10 The scope of investment management costs and that of treasury management costs can overlap. Only the cost of obtaining returns on which the NPO depends for its missional purposes is intended to be included in this category of fundraising costs. Treasury management activities for maintaining an NPO’s own cash flows, or to support the operation of the NPO, are generally not deemed to be investment management costs. An NPO needs to determine whether the returns are intended to support the NPO in delivering its missional purposes.

Calculating fundraising costs

- D3.11 In many cases, fundraising costs will need to be calculated by allocating direct and shared costs and apportioning support costs to fundraising activities to determine the full cost of those activities. This is the case even if an NPO decides to present support costs as a separate line item in a by function analysis of its expenses. In attributing costs to a fundraising activity, an NPO shall apply the general principles in paragraph D1.10.

- D3.12 An NPO shall select methods of cost allocation and apportionment that ensure that the disclosure of the costs of fundraising activities provide a faithful representation of the full costs of fundraising activities and provide information that is relevant to the users of the general purpose financial statements. Different methods may be appropriate depending on the type of fundraising activity.

- D3.13 An NPO shall ensure that the methods of allocating, bases of apportionment and aggregating costs to fundraising activities are reasonable and consistently applied within and between reporting periods unless circumstances change.

- D3.14 Where an NPO has the commercial and trading activities outlined in paragraph D3.7, fundraising costs shall include all costs to sell donated or commercial products including direct production costs, shared production costs and support costs.

- D3.15 Where an NPO has investments and investment managers deduct management fees from investment income, the NPO shall report the gross investment income before fees and then report the management fees charged as a cost.

Activities that have more than one purpose

- D3.16 Where an NPO has expenses that have been incurred for more than one purpose the expenses shall be split between those related to fundraising activities and those that are not related to fundraising using the cost allocation and apportionment principles in paragraph D1.10. Examples where costs need to be split across activities include raising funds while also raising

awareness of the activities of the NPO, or where costs incurred might be in relation to both investment management and treasury management activities.

- D3.17 Where splitting the costs in accordance with paragraph D3.16 results in undue cost or effort, an NPO may consider all such costs for activities that have more than one purpose as either fundraising costs or another activity. This shall depend on the primary purpose of the activity.

- D3.18 The undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph D3.17 applies when the costs of estimating or measuring the split are greater than the benefit.

Disclosures

- Costs related to each category of fundraising activities shall be disclosed separately, unless an individual category is immaterial. Where the costs related to an individual fundraising activity category are immaterial, the NPO shall provide a narrative description of the activity. Where the costs for all of the categories of fundraising activities are immaterial an NPO shall provide a narrative description for each category.

- D3.20 An NPO shall present fundraising costs in each category on a gross basis. Costs shall not be netted off from the income they have assisted in generating. This follows the general requirement to account for transactions gross except where explicitly permitted. Where an NPO deems that users of the general purpose financial reports would find the information useful, it may present an analysis of revenue raised alongside the costs associated with specific activities provided that the costs and related revenue are presented gross.

- D3.21 An NPO shall provide a narrative description of the method of cost allocation and bases of apportionment adopted to calculate fundraising costs.

- D3.22 Where activities have more than one purpose (for example, fundraising and raising awareness of the NPO), an NPO shall disclose whether costs have been allocated between more than one purpose and provide a narrative description of these activities.

- D3.23 An NPO shall also disclose whether it has applied the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph D3.17 and provide the disclosures in accordance with paragraph A2.41.

D4 – Employee benefits

Scope of this Section

- D4.1 Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by an NPO in exchange for service rendered by employees, including directors and management. Employee benefits covered by this Section will be one of the following four types:

- (a) short-term employee benefits, which are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are wholly due within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service;

- (b) post-employment benefits, which are employee benefits (other than termination benefits) that are payable after the completion of employment;

- (c) other long-term employee benefits, which are employee benefits (other than post- employment benefits and termination benefits) that are not wholly due within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service; and

- (d) termination benefits, which are employee benefits payable as a result of either:

- (i) an NPO’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment before the normal retirement date; or

- (ii) an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment.

General recognition principle for all employee benefits

- D4.2 An NPO shall recognise the cost of all employee benefits to which its employees have become entitled as a result of service rendered to the NPO during the reporting period:

- (a) as a liability, after deducting amounts that have been paid either directly to the employees or as a contribution to an employee benefit fund. If the amount paid exceeds the obligation arising from service before the reporting date, an NPO shall recognise that excess as an asset to the extent that the prepayment will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.

- (b) as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

Short-term employee benefits

Examples

- D4.3 Short-term employee benefits include items such as:

- (a) wages, salaries and social security contributions;

- (b) short-term compensated absences (such as paid annual leave and paid sick leave) when the absences are expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related employee service;

- (c) bonuses payable within twelve months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service; and

- (d) non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods or services) for current employees.

Measurement of short-term benefits

- D4.4 When an employee has rendered service to an NPO during the reporting period, the NPO shall measure the amounts recognised in accordance with paragraph D4.2 at the undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service.

Recognition and measurement – short-term compensated absences

- An NPO may compensate employees for absence for various reasons including annual vacation leave and sick leave. Some short-term compensated absences accumulate – they can be carried forward and used in future periods if the employee does not use the current period’s entitlement in full. Examples include annual vacation leave and sick leave. An NPO shall recognise the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences when the employees render service that increases their entitlement to future compensated absences. The NPO shall measure the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences at the undiscounted additional amount that the NPO expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The NPO shall present this amount as a current liability at the reporting date.

- D4.6 An NPO shall recognise the cost of other (non-accumulating) compensated absences when the absences occur. The NPO shall measure the cost of non-accumulating compensated absences at the undiscounted amount of salaries and wages paid or payable for the period of absence.

Recognition – bonus plans

- D4.7 An NPO shall recognise the expected cost of bonus payments only when:

- (a) the NPO has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past events (this means that the NPO has no realistic alternative but to make the payments); and

- (b) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.

An NPO is not expected to have profit sharing arrangements. Exceptionally, where such arrangements exist, the requirements of this paragraph (D4.7) shall be followed.

Post-employment benefits – distinction between defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans

- D4.8 Post-employment benefits include, for example:

- (a) retirement benefits, such as pensions; and

- (b) other post-employment benefits, such as post-employment life insurance and post- employment medical care.

Arrangements whereby an NPO provides post-employment benefits are post-employment benefit plans. An NPO shall apply this Section to all such arrangements whether or not they involve the establishment of a separate entity to receive contributions and to pay benefits. In some cases, these arrangements are imposed by law instead of by action of the NPO. In some cases, these arrangements arise from actions of the NPO even in the absence of a formal, documented plan.

- D4.9 Post-employment benefit plans are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, depending on their principal terms and conditions:

- (a) defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an NPO pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions or to make direct benefit payments to employees if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Thus, the amount of the post-employment benefits received by the employee is determined by the amount of contributions paid by an NPO (and perhaps also the employee) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurer, together with investment returns arising from the contributions.

- (b) defined benefit plans are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans. Under defined benefit plans, the NPO’s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees, and actuarial risk (that benefits will cost more or less than expected) and investment risk (that returns on assets set aside to fund the benefits will differ from expectations) are borne, in substance, by the NPO. If actuarial or investment experience is worse than expected, the NPO’s obligation may be increased, and vice versa if actuarial or investment experience is better than expected.

Multi-employer plans and state plans

- D4.10 Multi-employer plans and state plans are classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans on the basis of the terms of the plan, including any constructive obligation that goes beyond the formal terms. However, if sufficient information is not available to use defined benefit accounting for a multi-employer plan or a state plan that is a defined benefit plan, an NPO shall account for the plan in accordance with paragraph D4.12 as if it was a defined contribution plan and make the disclosures required by paragraph D4.43.

Insured benefits

- D4.11 An NPO may pay insurance premiums to fund a post-employment benefit plan. The NPO shall treat such a plan as a defined contribution plan unless the NPO has a legal or constructive obligation either:

- (a) to pay the employee benefits directly when they become due; or

- (b) to pay further amounts if the insurer does not pay all future employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.

A constructive obligation could arise indirectly through the plan, through the mechanism for setting future premiums, or through a related party relationship with the insurer. If the NPO retains such a legal or constructive obligation, the NPO shall treat the plan as a defined benefit plan.

Post-employment benefits – defined contribution plans

Recognition and measurement

- D4.12 An NPO shall recognise the contribution payable for a period:

- (a) as a liability, after deducting any amount already paid. If contribution payments exceed the contribution due for service before the reporting date, an NPO shall recognise that excess as an asset.

- (b) as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

Post-employment benefits – defined benefit plans

Recognition

- D4.13 In applying the general recognition principle in paragraph D4.2 to defined benefit plans, an NPO shall recognise:

- (a) a liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans net of plan assets – its ‘defined benefit liability’ (see paragraphs D4.14–D4.22); and

- (b) the net change in that liability during the period as the cost of its defined benefit plans during the period (see paragraphs D4.23–D4.26).

Measurement of the defined benefit liability

- D4.14 An NPO shall measure a defined benefit liability for its obligations under defined benefit plans at the net total of the following amounts:

- (a) the present value of its obligations under defined benefit plans (its defined benefit obligation) at the reporting date (paragraphs D4.15–D4.21 provide guidance for measuring this obligation); minus

- (b) the fair value at the reporting date of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. A4 Fair value measurement provides guidance for determining the fair values of those plan assets.

Inclusion of both vested and unvested benefits

- The present value of an NPO’s obligations under defined benefit plans at the reporting date shall reflect the estimated amount of benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, including benefits that are not yet vested (see paragraph D4.25) and including the effects of benefit formulas that give employees greater benefits for later years of service. This requires the NPO to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior periods on the basis of the plan’s benefit formula and to make estimates (actuarial assumptions) about demographic variables (such as employee turnover and mortality) and financial variables (such as future increases in salaries and medical costs) that influence the cost of the benefit. The actuarial assumptions shall be unbiased (neither imprudent nor excessively conservative), mutually compatible and selected to lead to the best estimate of the future cash flows that will arise under the plan.

Discounting

- An NPO shall determine the rate used to discount the future payments by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds. For currencies for which there is no deep market in such high-quality corporate bonds, the NPO shall use the market yields (at the reporting date) on government bonds denominated in that currency. The currency and term of the corporate bonds or government bonds shall be consistent with the currency and estimated period of the future payments.

Actuarial valuation method

- If an NPO is able, without undue cost or effort, to use the projected unit credit method to measure its defined benefit obligation and the related expense, it shall do so. If defined benefits are based on future salaries, the projected unit credit method requires an NPO to measure its defined benefit obligations on a basis that reflects estimated future salary increases. Additionally, the projected unit credit method requires an NPO to make various

actuarial assumptions in measuring the defined benefit obligation, including discount rates, the expected rates of return on plan assets, expected rates of salary increases, employee turnover, mortality and (for defined benefit medical plans) medical cost trend rates.

- D4.18 If using the projected unit credit method to measure an NPO’s obligation and cost under defined benefit plans would involve undue cost or effort, the NPO is permitted to measure the obligation with respect to current employees by both:

- (a) assuming all the NPO’s employees terminate their employment at the reporting date and ignoring:

- (i) estimated future salary increases;

- (ii) future service;

- (iii) possible in-service mortality of current employees between the reporting date and the date employees are expected to begin receiving post-employment benefits (that is, assume all current employees will receive the post-employment benefits). Mortality after service (that is, life expectancy) shall be considered.

- (b) not discounting that obligation.

An NPO that uses the foregoing measurement simplification must still include both vested benefits and unvested benefits when measuring its obligation under defined benefit plans.

- This Standard does not require an NPO to engage an independent actuary to perform the comprehensive actuarial valuation needed to calculate its defined benefit obligation. Nor does it require that a comprehensive actuarial valuation must be done annually. In the periods between comprehensive actuarial valuations, if the principal actuarial assumptions have not changed significantly, the defined benefit obligation can be measured by adjusting the prior period measurement for changes in employee demographics such as number of employees and salary levels.

Plan introductions, changes, curtailments and settlements

- D4.20 If a defined benefit plan has been introduced or changed in the current period, the NPO shall increase or decrease its defined benefit liability to reflect the change and shall recognise the increase (decrease) as an expense (income) in measuring surplus or deficit in the current period. Conversely, if a plan has been curtailed (that is, benefits or group of covered employees are reduced) or settled (the employer’s obligation is completely discharged) in the current period, the defined benefit obligation shall be decreased or eliminated and the NPO shall recognise the resulting gain or loss in surplus or deficit in the current period.

Defined benefit plan asset

- If the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date is less than the fair value of plan assets at that date, the plan has a surplus. An NPO shall recognise a plan surplus as a defined benefit plan asset only to the extent that it is able to recover the surplus, either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the plan.

Cost of a defined benefit plan

- D4.22 An NPO shall recognise the net change in its defined benefit liability during the period, other than a change attributable to benefits paid to employees during the period or to contributions from the employer, as the cost of its defined benefit plans during the period. That cost is recognised either entirely in surplus or deficit as an expense or partly in surplus or deficit and partly as an item of income and expense recognised directly in changes in net assets

(see paragraph D4.23) unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

- D4.23 An NPO is required to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur. An NPO shall:

- (a) recognise all actuarial gains and losses in surplus or deficit; or

- (b) recognise all actuarial gains and losses through income and expenses recognised directly in changes in net assets;

as an accounting policy election. The NPO shall apply its chosen accounting policy consistently to all of its defined benefit plans and all of its actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses recognised in changes in net assets shall be presented in the Statement of Changes

in Net Assets.

- D4.24 The net change in the defined benefit liability that is recognised as the cost of a defined benefit plan includes:

- (a) the change in the defined benefit liability arising from employee service rendered during the reporting period;

- interest on the defined benefit obligation during the reporting period;

- (c) the returns on any plan assets and the net change in the fair value of recognised reimbursement rights (see paragraph D4.27) during the reporting period;

- (d) actuarial gains and losses arising in the reporting period;

- increases or decreases in the defined benefit liability resulting from introducing a new plan or changing an existing plan in the reporting period (see paragraph D4.20); and

- (f) decreases in the defined benefit liability resulting from curtailing or settling an existing plan in the reporting period (see paragraph D4.20).

- Employee service gives rise to an obligation under a defined benefit plan, even if the benefits are conditional on future employment (in other words, they are not yet vested). In measuring its defined benefit obligation, an NPO considers the probability that some employees may not satisfy vesting requirements. Similarly, although some post-employment benefits (such as post-employment medical benefits) become payable only if a specified event occurs when an employee is no longer employed (such as an illness), an obligation is created when the employee renders service that will provide entitlement to the benefit if the specified event occurs. The probability that the specified event will occur affects the measurement of the obligation but does not determine whether the obligation exists.

- D4.26 If defined benefits are reduced for amounts that will be paid to employees under government- sponsored plans, an NPO shall measure its defined benefit obligations on a basis that reflects the benefits payable under the government plans, but only if:

- (a) those plans were enacted before the reporting date; or

- (b) past history or other reliable evidence indicates that those state benefits will change in some predictable manner – for example, in line with future changes in general price levels or general salary levels.

Reimbursements

- D4.27 If an NPO is virtually certain that another party will reimburse some or all of the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation, the NPO shall recognise its right to reimbursement as a separate asset. The NPO shall measure the asset at fair value. In the

Statement of Income and Expenses, the expense relating to a defined benefit plan may be presented net of the amount recognised for a reimbursement.

Other long-term employee benefits

- D4.28 Other long-term employee benefits include, for example:

- (a) long-term compensated absences such as long-service or sabbatical leave;

- (b) long-service benefits;

- (c) long-term disability benefits;

- (d) bonuses payable twelve months or more after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service; and

- (e) deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of the period in which it is earned.

- D4.29 An NPO shall recognise a liability for other long-term employee benefits measured at the net total of the following amounts:

- (a) the present value of the benefit obligation at the reporting date; minus

- (b) the fair value at the reporting date of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.

An NPO shall recognise the net change in the liability during the period, other than a change attributable to benefits paid to employees during the period or to contributions from the employer, as the cost of its other long-term employee benefits during the period. That cost is recognised entirely in surplus or deficit as an expense unless another section of this Standard requires it to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset, such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

Termination benefits

- Termination benefits result from either an entity’s decision to terminate employment or an employee’s decision to accept an entity’s offer of benefits in exchange for termination of employment. The form of the employee benefit does not determine whether it is provided in exchange for service or in exchange for termination of the employee’s employment. Some termination benefits are provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan. For example, the benefits might be specified by statute, employment contract or union agreement, or might be implied as a result of the employer’s past practice of providing similar benefits. Employee benefits provided in accordance with the terms of an employee benefit plan are termination benefits if they both result from an NPO’s decision to terminate employment and are not conditional on future service being provided.

Recognition

- D4.31 Because termination benefits do not provide an NPO with future economic benefits, an NPO shall recognise them as an expense in surplus or deficit immediately.

- D4.32 When an NPO recognises termination benefits, the NPO may also have to account for a curtailment of retirement benefits or other employee benefits.

- D4.33 An NPO shall recognise a liability and an expense for termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates:

- (a) the date at which the NPO can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and

- (b) the date at which the NPO recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of D5 Provisions and contingencies and involves the payment of termination benefits.

- D4.34 For termination benefits payable as a result of an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment, the time when an NPO can no longer withdraw the offer of termination benefits is the earlier of:

- the date at which the employee accepts the offer.

- (b) the date at which a restriction (for example, a legal, regulatory or contractual requirement or other restriction) on the NPO’s ability to withdraw the offer takes effect – which would be when the offer is made, if the restriction existed at the time of the offer.

- D4.35 For termination benefits payable as a result of an NPO’s decision to terminate an employee’s employment, the NPO can no longer withdraw the offer after it has communicated to the affected employees a termination plan for which all of these criteria apply:

- (a) actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made;

- (b) the plan identifies the number of employees whose employment is to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations (but the plan need not identify each individual employee) and the expected completion date; and

- (c) the plan establishes the termination benefits that employees will receive in sufficient detail that employees can determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive when their employment is terminated.

Measurement

- An NPO shall measure termination benefits at the best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the measurement of termination benefits shall be based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer.

- D4.37 When termination benefits are due more than twelve months after the end of the reporting period, they shall be measured at their present value.

Group plans

- If a controlling NPO provides benefits to the employees of one or more controlled entities in the group, and the controlling NPO presents consolidated financial statements using this Standard, such controlled entities are permitted to recognise and measure employee benefit expense on the basis of a reasonable allocation of the expense recognised for the group.

Disclosures

Disclosures about short-term employee benefits

- D4.39 Disclosure shall be made for each of the following short-term employee benefits that are recognised as an expense in the reporting period:

- (a) wages, salaries and social security contribution;

- (b) non-monetary benefits (such as medical care, housing, cars and free or subsidised goods or services (other than those provided on the same terms as other eligible service recipients)) for current employees;

- (c) bonuses paid within 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service; and

- (d) other staff-related statutory or contractual costs.

Short-term employee benefits shall be disclosed separately from other employee benefits. Termination benefits shall be reported in accordance with paragraph D4.51. The cost of pension arrangements shall be reported in accordance with paragraphs D4.43 (defined contribution plans) and D4.44 (defined benefit plans).

- D4.40 Non-executive members of the NPO’s governing body are not considered employees for the purposes of this disclosure and their personnel compensation and expenses are to be disclosed in accordance with paragraph H1.9.

- D4.41 Where a non-executive governing body member is also an employee of the NPO, their total remuneration shall be distinguished between compensation for their employee role and their governance role, where these can be separated. Employee compensation and benefits shall be disclosed in accordance with paragraph D4.39. Any additional compensation related to governing body member shall be disclosed separately under paragraph H1.9(b).

- D4.42 Executive members of the NPO’s governing body shall be disclosed as employees and follow the disclosures in D4.39. The names of executive member of the NPO’s governing body shall be disclosed unless already disclosed in accordance with another INPAS requirement.

Disclosures about defined contribution plans

- An NPO shall disclose the amount recognised in surplus or deficit as an expense for defined contribution plans. If an NPO treats a defined benefit multi-employer or state plan as a defined contribution plan because sufficient information for defined benefit accounting is not available (see paragraph D4.10), it shall disclose the fact that the plan is a defined benefit plan and the reason why it is being accounted for as a defined contribution plan, along with any available information about the plan’s surplus or deficit and the implications, if any, for the NPO.

Disclosures about defined benefit plans

- D4.44 Except for any defined benefit multi-employer or state plan that is accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with paragraph D4.10, (and to which paragraph D4.43 applies), an NPO shall disclose the following information about defined benefit plans:

- (a) a general description of the type of plan, including funding policy;

- (b) the NPO’s accounting policy for recognising actuarial gains and losses (either in surplus or deficit or as an item of income and expense recognised directly in changes in net assets) and the amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised during the period;

- (c) if the NPO applies paragraph D4.18 in measuring its defined benefit obligation, it shall disclose:

- (i) that fact;

- (ii) the reasons why using the projected unit credit method to measure its obligation and cost under defined benefit plans would involve undue cost or effort; and

- (iii) its assumptions for measuring its obligation;

- (d) the date of the most recent comprehensive actuarial valuation and, if it was not as of the reporting date, a description of the adjustments that were made to measure the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date;

- (e) a reconciliation of opening and closing balances of the defined benefit obligation showing separately, if applicable:

- (i) the change in the defined benefit liability arising from employee service rendered during the reporting period;

- (ii) the interest on the defined benefit obligation during the reporting period;

- (iv) the changes resulting from introducing a new plan or changing an existing plan in the reporting period;

- the benefits paid; and

- (vi) all other changes;

- (f) a reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of the plan assets and of the opening and closing balances of any reimbursement right recognised as an asset, showing separately, when applicable:

- (i) contributions;

- (ii) benefits paid;

- (iii) the return on plan assets and the net change in the fair value of recognised reimbursement rights (see paragraph D4.27) during the reporting period; and

- (iv) other changes in plan assets.

- for each major class of plan assets, which shall include but is not limited to equity instruments, debt instruments, property and all other assets, the percentage or amount that each major class of plan assets constitutes of the fair value of the total plan assets at the reporting date;

- the amounts included in the fair value of plan assets for:

- (i) each class of the NPO’s own financial instruments; and

- (ii) any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the NPO.

- (i) the discount rates;

- (ii) the expected rates of return on any plan assets for the periods presented in the financial statements;

- (iii) the expected rates of salary increases;

- (iv) medical cost trend rates;

- (v) any other material actuarial assumptions used; and

- (j) the expected contributions to the defined benefit plan for the next annual reporting period.

- D4.45 The reconciliations in D4.44 (e) and D4.44(f) are not required to be presented for prior periods.

- D4.46 If an NPO has more than one defined benefit plan, the NPO is permitted to make the disclosures required by paragraph D4.44 in total, separately for each plan, or in such groupings the NPO considers to be the most useful.

- D4.47 If an NPO participates in a defined benefit plan that is a group plan, it shall disclose:

- (a) the contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost or the fact that there is no such policy;

- the policy for determining the contribution to be paid by the NPO; and

- if the NPO accounts for an allocation of the net defined benefit cost as noted in paragraph D4.38, all the information about the plan as a whole required by paragraph D4.44.

- D4.48 The information required by paragraph D4.47(c) can be disclosed by cross-reference to disclosures required by these subparagraphs in another group entity’s financial statements if:

- (a) that group entity’s financial statements separately identify and disclose the information required about the plan; and

- (b) that group entity’s financial statements are available to users of the financial statements on the same terms as the financial statements of the NPO and at the same time as, or earlier than, the financial statements of the NPO.

- D4.49 If required by D5, an NPO discloses information about contingent liabilities arising from post- employment benefit obligations.

Disclosures about other long-term employee benefits

- D4.50 For each category of other long-term employee benefits that an NPO provides to its employees, the NPO shall disclose the nature of the benefit, the amount of its obligation and the extent of funding at the reporting date.

Disclosures about termination benefits

- D4.51 For each category of termination benefits that an NPO provides to its employees, the NPO shall disclose the nature of the benefit, the amount of its obligation and the extent of funding at the reporting date.

D5 – Provisions and contingencies

Scope of this Section

- D5.1 This Section applies to all provisions (liabilities of uncertain timing or amount), contingent liabilities and contingent assets except those provisions covered by other sections of this Standard, which include provisions relating to:

- (a) leases (D6 Leases). However, this Section deals with operating leases that have become onerous.

- (b) revenue (C1 Revenue). However, this Section deals with grant agreements and contracts with customers that have become onerous.

- (c) employee benefit obligations (D4 Employee benefits).

- (d) income tax (D8 Income tax).

- (e) contingent consideration of an acquirer in a business combination (G4 Business combinations and goodwill).

- D5.2 This Section applies to financial guarantee contracts issued at nil consideration when the specified debtor is another entity within the group. Other issued financial guarantee contracts are in the scope of F1 Financial instruments Part II.

- The requirements in this Section do not apply to executory contracts unless they are onerous contracts or onerous grant agreements. Executory contracts are contracts under which neither party has fulfilled any of its obligations or both parties have partially fulfilled their obligations to an equal extent.

- D5.4 The word ‘provision’ is sometimes used in the context of such items as depreciation, impairment of assets and uncollectable receivables. Those are adjustments of the carrying amounts of assets instead of recognition of liabilities and therefore are not covered by this Section.

Initial recognition

- D5.5 An NPO shall recognise a provision only when:

- (a) the NPO has an obligation at the reporting date as a result of past events;

- (b) it is probable (that is, more likely than not) that the NPO will be required to transfer economic benefits in settlement; and

- (c) the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.4

- D5.6 The NPO shall recognise the provision as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position and shall recognise the amount of the provision as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

- D5.7 The condition in paragraph D5.5(a) (obligation at the reporting date as a result of a past event) means that the NPO has no realistic alternative to settling the obligation. This can happen when the NPO has a legal obligation that can be enforced by law or when the NPO

- 4 This Section uses the term provision in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of a liability in paragraph A2.63 and the Glossary. For the purpose of this Section, a liability is a present obligation of the NPO arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the NPO of resources embodying economic benefits.

has a constructive obligation because the past event (which may be an action of the NPO) has created valid expectations in other parties that the NPO will discharge the obligation. Obligations that will arise from the NPO’s future actions (that is, the future conduct of its activities) do not satisfy the condition in paragraph D5.5(a), no matter how likely they are to occur and even if they are contractual. To illustrate, because of operational pressures or legal requirements, an NPO may intend or need to carry out expenditure to operate in a particular way in the future (for example, by fitting safety equipment in an operational building). Because the NPO can avoid the future expenditure by its future actions – for example, by changing its method of operation or selling the operational building – it has no present obligation for that future expenditure and no provision is recognised.

- D5.8 A restructuring is a programme that is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of an activity undertaken by an NPO or the manner in which that activity is conducted. Examples of events that may fall under the definition of restructuring:

- (a) sale or termination of a set of activities linked to an NPO’s purpose;

- (b) the closure of operational locations in a country or region or the relocation of activities from one country or region to another;

- changes in management structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management; and

- (d) fundamental reorganisations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the NPO’s operations.

- D5.9 A constructive obligation to restructure arises only when an NPO:

- (a) has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring identifying at least:

- (i) the activities concerned;

- (ii) the principal locations affected;

- (iii) the location, function and approximate number of employees who will be compensated for terminating their services;

- (iv) the expenditures that will be undertaken; and

- (v) when the plan will be implemented.

- (b) has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement that plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it.

Initial measurement

- D5.10 An NPO shall measure a provision at the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the reporting date. The best estimate is the amount an NPO would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time:

- (a) when the provision involves a large population of items, the estimate of the amount reflects the weighting of all possible outcomes by their associated probabilities. Where there is a continuous range of possible outcomes, and each point in that range is as likely as any other, the mid-point of the range is used.

- (b) when the provision arises from a single obligation, the individual most likely outcome may be the best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation. However, even in such a case, the NPO considers other possible outcomes. When other possible outcomes are either mostly higher or mostly lower than the most likely outcome, the best estimate will be a higher or lower amount than the most likely outcome.

When the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of a provision shall be the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation. The discount rate (or rates) shall be a pre-tax rate (or rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of the time value of money. The risks specific to the liability shall be reflected either in the discount rate or in the estimation of the amounts required to settle the obligation, but not both.

- D5.11 An NPO shall exclude gains from the expected disposal of assets from the measurement of a provision.

- D5.12 When some or all of the amount required to settle a provision may be reimbursed by another party (for example, through an insurance claim), the NPO shall recognise the reimbursement as a separate asset only when it is virtually certain that the NPO will receive the reimbursement on settlement of the obligation. The amount recognised for the reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of the provision. The reimbursement receivable shall be presented in the Statement of Financial Position as an asset and shall not be offset against the provision. In the Statement of Income and Expenses, the NPO may offset any reimbursement from another party against the expense relating to the provision.

Subsequent measurement

- D5.13 An NPO shall charge against a provision only those expenditures for which the provision was originally recognised.

- An NPO shall review provisions at each reporting date and adjust them to reflect the current best estimate of the amount that would be required to settle the obligation at that reporting date. Any adjustments to the amounts previously recognised shall be recognised in surplus or deficit unless the provision was originally recognised as part of the cost of an asset (see paragraph D5.6). When a provision is measured at the present value of the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation, the unwinding of the discount shall be recognised as a finance cost in surplus or deficit in the period it arises.

Contingent liabilities

- A contingent liability is either a possible but uncertain obligation or a present obligation that is not recognised because it fails to meet one or both of the conditions (b) and (c) in paragraph D5.5. An NPO shall not recognise a contingent liability as a liability, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination (see paragraph G4.20). Disclosure of a contingent liability is required by paragraph D5.18 unless the possibility of an outflow of resources is remote. When an NPO is jointly and severally liable for an obligation, the part of the obligation that is expected to be met by other parties is treated as a contingent liability.

Contingent assets

- D5.16 An NPO shall not recognise a contingent asset as an asset. Disclosure of a contingent asset is required by paragraph D5.19 when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. However, when the flow of future economic benefits to the NPO is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset, and its recognition is appropriate.

Group D – Expenses and liabilities D5 – Provisions and contingencies

Disclosures about provisions

- D5.17 For each class of provision, an NPO shall disclose all of the following:

- (a) a reconciliation showing:

- (i) the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period;

- (ii) additions during the period, including adjustments that result from changes in measuring the discounted amount;

- (iii) amounts charged against the provision during the period; and

- (iv) unused amounts reversed during the period.

- (b) a brief description of the nature of the obligation and the expected amount and timing of any resulting payments;

- (c) an indication of the uncertainties about the amount or timing of those outflows; and

- (d) the amount of any expected reimbursement, stating the amount of any asset that has been recognised for that expected reimbursement.

Comparative information for prior periods is not required.

Disclosures about contingent liabilities

- D5.18 Unless the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, an NPO shall disclose, for each class of contingent liability at the reporting date, a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability and, when practicable:

- (a) an estimate of its financial effect, measured in accordance with paragraphs D5.10–D5.14;

- (b) an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of any outflow; and

- (c) the possibility of any reimbursement.

If it is impracticable to make one or more of these disclosures, that fact shall be stated.

Disclosures about contingent assets

- If an inflow of economic benefits is probable (more likely than not) but not virtually certain, an NPO shall disclose a description of the nature of the contingent assets at the end of the reporting period and, unless it would involve undue cost or effort, an estimate of their financial effect, measured using the principles set out in paragraphs D5.10–D5.14. If such an estimate would involve undue cost or effort, the NPO shall disclose that fact and the reasons why estimating the financial effect would involve undue cost or effort.

Prejudicial disclosures

- D5.20 In extremely rare cases, disclosure of some or all of the information required by paragraphs D5.17–D5.19 can be expected to prejudice seriously the position of the NPO in a dispute with other parties on the subject matter of the provision, contingent liability or contingent asset. In such cases, an NPO need not disclose the information, but shall disclose the general nature of the dispute, together with the fact that, and reason why, the information has not been disclosed.

Disclosures about financial guarantee contracts

- D5.21 An NPO shall disclose for issued financial guarantee contracts in the scope of this Section (see paragraph D5.2):

- (a) the nature and operational purpose of these contracts;

- (b) an indication of the uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of any outflow of resources; and

- (c) the maximum amount the NPO could be required to pay if the guarantees are called on.

- D5.22 An NPO shall also make the disclosures required by H1 Related party disclosures and, if applicable, the disclosures required by paragraphs D5.17 and D5.18.

D6 – Leases

Scope of this Section

- D6.1 This Section covers accounting for all leases other than:

- (a) leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources (see E6 Specialised activities);

- (b) licensing agreements for such items as motion picture films, video recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights (see E4 Intangible assets other than goodwill);

- (c) measurement of property held by lessees that is accounted for as investment property and measurement of investment property provided by lessors under operating leases (see E3 Investment property);

- (d) measurement of biological assets held by lessees under finance leases and biological assets provided by lessors under operating leases (see E6);

- (e) leases that could lead to a loss to the lessor or the lessee as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to changes in the price of the leased asset, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in lease payments based on variable market interest rates, or a default by one of the counterparties (see paragraph F1.52(f)); and

- (f) operating leases that are onerous.

- This Section applies to agreements that transfer the right to use assets even though substantial services by the lessor may be called for in connection with the operation or maintenance of such assets. This Section does not apply to agreements that are contracts for services that do not transfer the right to use assets from one contracting party to the other.

- Some arrangements, such as some outsourcing arrangements, telecommunication contracts that provide rights to capacity and take-or-pay contracts, do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to use assets in return for payments. Such arrangements are in substance leases of assets, and they shall be accounted for under this Section.

Classification of leases

- D6.4 A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership.

- D6.5 Whether a lease is a finance lease or an operating lease depends on the substance of the transaction instead of the form of the contract. Examples of situations that individually or in combination would normally lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:

- (a) the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;

- (b) the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at a price that is expected to be sufficiently lower than the fair value at the date the option becomes exercisable for it to be reasonably certain, at the inception of the lease, that the option will be exercised;

- (c) the lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset even if title is not transferred;

- (d) at the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments amounts to at least substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset; and

- (e) the leased assets are of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use them without major modifications.

- D6.6 Indicators of situations that individually or in combination could also lead to a lease being classified as a finance lease are:

- (a) if the lessee can cancel the lease, the lessor’s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee;

- (b) gains or losses from the fluctuation in the residual value of the leased asset accrue to the lessee (for example, in the form of a rent rebate equalling most of the sales proceeds at the end of the lease); and

- (c) the lessee has the ability to continue the lease for a secondary period at a rent that is substantially lower than market rent.

- D6.7 The examples and indicators in paragraphs D6.5 and D6.6 are not always conclusive. If it is clear from other features that the lease does not transfer substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership, the lease is classified as an operating lease. For example, this may be the case if ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease for a variable payment equal to the asset’s then fair value, or if there are contingent rents, as a result of which the lessee does not have substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership.

- D6.8 Lease classification is made at the inception of the lease and is not changed during the term of the lease unless the lessee and the lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease (other than simply by renewing the lease), in which case the lease classification shall be re-evaluated.

Financial statements of lessees – finance leases

Initial recognition

- D6.9 At the commencement of the lease term, a lessee shall recognise its rights of use and obligations under finance leases as assets and liabilities in its Statement of Financial Position at amounts equal to the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, determined at the inception of the lease. Any initial direct costs of the lessee (incremental costs that are directly attributable to negotiating and arranging a lease) are added to the amount recognised as an asset.

- D6.10 The present value of the minimum lease payments shall be calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this cannot be determined, the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate shall be used.

Subsequent measurement

- A lessee shall apportion minimum lease payments between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability using the effective interest method (see paragraphs F1.22–F1.27). The lessee shall allocate the finance charge to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. A lessee shall charge contingent rents as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

- D6.12 A lessee shall depreciate an asset leased under a finance lease in accordance with the relevant section of this Standard for that type of asset – for example, E2 Property, plant and equipment, E4 or G4 Business combinations and goodwill. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset shall be fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and its useful life. A lessee shall also assess at each reporting date whether an asset leased under a finance lease is impaired (see E5 Impairment of assets).

Disclosures

- D6.13 A lessee shall make the following disclosures for finance leases:

- (a) for each class of asset, the net carrying amount at the end of the reporting period;

- (b) the total of future minimum lease payments at the end of the reporting period for each of the following periods:

- (i) not later than one year;

- (ii) later than one year and not later than five years; and

- (iii) later than five years.

- (c) a general description of the lessee’s significant leasing arrangements including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases and restrictions imposed by lease arrangements.

- D6.14 In addition, the requirements for disclosure about assets in accordance with Sections E2, E4, E5 and E6 apply to lessees for assets leased under finance leases.

Financial statements of lessees – operating leases

- D6.15 A lessee shall recognise lease payments under operating leases (excluding costs for services such as insurance and maintenance) as an expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis unless either:

- (a) another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the user’s benefit, even if the payments are not on that basis; or

- (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation (based on published indexes or statistics) to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.

If payments to the lessor vary because of factors other than general inflation, then condition (b) is not met.

Disclosures

- D6.16 A lessee shall make the following disclosures for operating leases:

- (a) the total of future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the following periods:

- (i) not later than one year;

- (ii) later than one year and not later than five years; and

- (iii) later than five years.

- (b) lease payments recognised as an expense; and

- (c) a general description of the lessee’s significant leasing arrangements including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases and restrictions imposed by lease arrangements.

Financial statements of lessors – finance leases

Initial recognition and measurement

- D6.17 A lessor shall recognise assets held under a finance lease in its Statement of Financial Position and present them as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.

The net investment in a lease is the lessor’s gross investment in the lease discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. The gross investment in the lease is the aggregate of:

- (a) the minimum lease payments receivable by the lessor under a finance lease; and (b) any unguaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor.

- D6.18 For finance leases other than those involving manufacturer or dealer lessors, initial direct costs (costs that are incremental and directly attributable to negotiating and arranging a lease) are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivable and reduce the amount of revenue recognised over the lease term.

- The recognition of finance income shall be based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor’s net investment in the finance lease. Lease payments relating to the period, excluding costs for services, are applied against the gross investment in the lease to reduce both the principal and the unearned finance income. If there is an indication that the estimated, unguaranteed residual value used in computing the lessor’s gross investment in the lease has changed significantly, the income allocation over the lease term is revised, and any reduction in respect of amounts accrued is recognised immediately in surplus or deficit.

Manufacturer or dealer lessors

- D6.20 Manufacturers or dealers often offer to customers the choice of either buying or leasing an asset. A finance lease of an asset by a manufacturer or dealer lessor gives rise to two types of income:

- (a) surplus or deficit equivalent to the surplus or deficit resulting from an outright sale of the asset being leased at normal selling prices, reflecting any applicable volume or trade discounts; and

- (b) finance income over the lease term.

- The sales revenue recognised at the commencement of the lease term by a manufacturer or dealer lessor is the fair value of the asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments accruing to the lessor, computed at a market rate of interest. The cost of sale recognised at the commencement of the lease term is the cost, or carrying amount if different, of the leased asset less the present value of the unguaranteed residual value. The difference between the sales revenue and the cost of sale is the surplus, which is recognised in accordance with the NPO’s policy for outright sales.

- D6.22 If artificially low rates of interest are quoted, surplus shall be restricted to that which would apply if a market rate of interest were charged. Costs incurred by manufacturer or dealer lessors in connection with negotiating and arranging a lease shall be recognised as an expense when the surplus is recognised.

Disclosures

- D6.23 A lessor shall make the following disclosures for finance leases:

- (a) a reconciliation between the gross investment in the lease at the end of the reporting period and the present value of minimum lease payments receivable at the end of the reporting period. In addition, a lessor shall disclose the gross investment in the lease and the present value of minimum lease payments receivable at the end of the reporting period for each of the following periods:

- (i) not later than one year;

- later than one year and not later than five years; and

- (iii) later than five years.

- (b) unearned finance income.

- the unguaranteed residual values accruing to the benefit of the lessor.

- the accumulated allowance for uncollectable minimum lease payments receivable.

- (e) contingent rents recognised as income in the period.

- (f) a general description of the lessor’s significant leasing arrangements including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses, subleases and restrictions imposed by lease arrangements.

Financial statements of lessors – operating leases

Recognition and measurement

- D6.24 A lessor shall present assets subject to operating leases in its Statement of Financial Position according to the nature of the asset.

- D6.25 A lessor shall recognise lease income from operating leases (excluding amounts for services such as insurance and maintenance) in surplus or deficit on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless either:

- (a) another systematic basis is representative of the time pattern of the lessee’s benefit from the leased asset, even if the receipt of payments is not on that basis; or

- (b) the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation (based on published indexes or statistics) to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increases.

If payments to the lessor vary according to factors other than inflation, then condition (b) is not met.

- A lessor shall recognise as an expense costs, including depreciation, incurred in earning the lease income. The depreciation policy for depreciable leased assets shall be consistent with the lessor’s normal depreciation policy for similar assets.

- A lessor shall add to the carrying amount of the leased asset any initial direct costs it incurs in negotiating and arranging an operating lease and shall recognise such costs as an expense over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.

- D6.28 To determine whether a leased asset has become impaired, a lessor shall apply E5.

- D6.29 A manufacturer or dealer lessor does not recognise any surplus on entering into an operating lease because it is not the equivalent of a sale.

Disclosures

- D6.30 A lessor shall disclose the following for operating leases:

- (a) the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the following periods:

- (i) not later than one year;

- (ii) later than one year and not later than five years; and

- (iii) later than five years.

- (b) total contingent rents recognised as income; and

- (c) a general description of the lessor’s significant leasing arrangements including, for example, information about contingent rent, renewal or purchase options and escalation clauses and restrictions imposed by lease arrangements.

- D6.31 In addition, the requirements for disclosure about assets in accordance with Sections E2, E3, E5 and E6 apply to lessors for assets provided under operating leases.

Sale and leaseback transactions

- A sale and leaseback transaction involves the sale of an asset and the leasing back of the same asset. The lease payment and the sale price are usually interdependent because they are negotiated as a package. The accounting treatment of a sale and leaseback transaction depends on the type of lease.

Sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease

- D6.33 If a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease, the seller-lessee shall not recognise immediately as income any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount. Instead the seller-lessee shall defer such excess and amortise it over the lease term.

Sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating lease

- If a sale and leaseback transaction results in an operating lease, and it is clear that the transaction is established at fair value, the seller-lessee shall recognise any surplus or deficit immediately. If the sale price is below fair value, the seller-lessee shall recognise any surplus or deficit immediately unless the deficit is compensated for by future lease payments at below market price. In that case, the seller-lessee shall defer and amortise such deficit in proportion to the lease payments over the period for which the asset is expected to be used. If the sale price is above fair value, the seller-lessee shall defer the excess over fair value and amortise it over the period for which the asset is expected to be used.

Disclosures

- Disclosure requirements for lessees and lessors apply equally to sale and leaseback transactions. The required description of significant leasing arrangements includes description of unique or unusual provisions of the agreement or terms of the sale and leaseback transactions.

D7 – Borrowing costs

Scope of this Section

- D7.1 This Section specifies the accounting for borrowing costs. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs that an NPO incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs include:

- (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in F1 Financial instruments;

- (b) finance charges in respect of finance leases recognised in accordance with D6 Leases; and

- (c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.

Recognition

- D7.2 An NPO shall recognise all borrowing costs as an expense in surplus or deficit in the period in which they are incurred.

Disclosures

- D7.3 Paragraph B3.7(b) requires disclosure of finance costs. Paragraph F1.51(b) requires disclosure of total interest expense (using the effective interest method) for financial liabilities that are not at fair value through surplus or deficit. This Section does not require any additional disclosure.

D8 – Income tax

Scope of this Section

- For the purpose of this Standard, income tax includes all domestic and foreign taxes that are based on taxable profit. Income tax also includes taxes such as withholding taxes that are payable by a controlled entity, associate or joint arrangement on distributions to the reporting NPO. An NPO will need to comply with the reporting requirements of the domestic and foreign taxes applicable to it.

- This Section covers accounting for income tax. It requires an NPO to recognise the current and future tax consequences of transactions and other events that have been recognised in the financial statements. These recognised tax amounts comprise current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for the current period or past periods. Deferred tax is income tax payable or recoverable in future periods, generally as a result of the NPO recovering or settling its assets and liabilities for their current carrying amount, and the tax effect of the carry forward of currently unused tax losses and tax credits.

- D8.3 This Section does not deal with the methods of accounting for revenue from grants and donations (see C1 Part I Revenue from grants and donations). However, this Section does deal with the accounting for the tax implications of the temporary differences that may arise from such grants and donations.

- This Section applies to income taxes arising from tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-up taxes described in those rules. Such tax law, and the income taxes arising from it, are hereafter referred to as ‘Pillar Two legislation’ and ‘Pillar Two income taxes’. As an exception to the requirements in this Section, an NPO shall neither recognise deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes nor disclose information that would otherwise be required by paragraphs D8.47–D8.48 about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

- An NPO shall recognise a current tax liability for tax payable on the surplus (to the extent that the surplus is subject to tax) for the current and past periods. If the amount paid for the current and past periods exceeds the amount payable for those periods, the NPO shall recognise the excess as a current tax asset.

- D8.6 An NPO shall recognise a current tax asset for the benefit of a tax loss that can be carried back to recover tax paid in a previous period.

- An NPO shall measure a current tax liability (asset) at the amount it expects to pay (recover) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. An NPO shall regard tax rates and tax laws as substantively enacted when the remaining steps in the enactment process have not affected the outcome in the past and are unlikely to do so. Paragraphs D8.35–D8.36 provide additional measurement guidance.

Recognition of deferred tax

General recognition principle

- D8.8 It is inherent in the recognition of an asset or a liability that the reporting NPO expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of that asset or liability. If it is probable that recovery or settlement of that carrying amount will make future tax payments larger (smaller) than they would be if such recovery or settlement were to have no tax consequences, this Section requires an NPO to recognise a deferred tax liability (deferred tax asset) with certain limited exceptions. If the NPO expects to recover the carrying amount of an asset or settle the carrying amount of a liability without affecting taxable profit, no deferred tax arises in respect of the asset or liability.

- D8.9 An NPO shall recognise a deferred tax asset or liability for tax recoverable or payable in future periods as a result of past transactions or events. Such tax arises from the differences between the carrying amounts of the NPO’s assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and the amounts attributed to those assets and liabilities by the tax authorities (such differences are called ‘temporary differences’), and the carry forward of currently unused tax losses and tax credits.

Tax bases and temporary differences

- The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an NPO when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.

- The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future periods. In the case of revenue that is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount less any amount of the revenue that will not be taxable in future periods.

- Some items have a tax base but are not recognised as assets and liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position. For example, research and development costs are recognised as an expense when determining an accounting surplus in the period in which they are incurred but may not be permitted as a deduction when determining taxable profit (tax loss) until a later period. The difference between the tax base of the research and development costs, being the amount that the taxation authorities will permit as a deduction in future periods, and the carrying amount of nil is a deductible temporary difference that results in a deferred tax asset.

- D8.13 Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the Statement of Financial Position and its tax base. In consolidated financial statements, temporary differences are determined by comparing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with the appropriate tax base. The tax base is determined by reference to a consolidated tax return in those jurisdictions in which such a return is filed. In other jurisdictions, the tax base is determined by reference to the tax returns of each entity in the group.

- D8.14 Examples of situations in which temporary differences arise include:

- (a) the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognised at their fair values in accordance G4 Business combinations and goodwill, but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes (for example, the tax base of an asset

may remain at cost to the previous owner). The resulting deferred tax asset or liability affects the amount of goodwill that an NPO recognises.

- (b) assets are remeasured but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes. For example, this Standard permits or requires certain assets to be remeasured at fair value or to be revalued (for example, E3 Investment property and E2 Property, plant and equipment).

- (c) goodwill arises in a business combination – for example, the tax base of goodwill will be nil if taxation authorities do not allow the amortisation or the impairment of goodwill as a deductible expense when taxable profit is determined and do not permit the cost of goodwill to be treated as a deductible expense on disposal of the controlled entity.

- (d) the tax base of an asset or a liability on initial recognition differs from its initial carrying amount.

- (e) the carrying amount of investments in controlled entities, branches and associates or interests in joint arrangements becomes different from the tax base of the investment or interest.

Not all of these temporary differences will give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities (see paragraphs D8.15 and D8.17).

Taxable temporary differences

- D8.15 A deferred tax liability shall be recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except to the extent that the deferred tax liability arises from:

- (a) the initial recognition of goodwill; or

- the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that:

- (i) is not a business combination; and

- (ii) at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting surplus nor taxable profit (tax loss).

However, for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in controlled entities, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, a deferred tax liability shall be recognised in accordance with paragraph D8.28.

- Some temporary differences arise when income or expense is included in an accounting surplus in one period but is included in taxable profit in a different period. Such temporary differences are often described as timing differences. The following are examples of temporary differences of this kind that are taxable temporary differences and that therefore result in deferred tax liabilities:

- (a) interest revenue is included in an accounting surplus on a time-proportion basis but may, in some jurisdictions, be included in taxable profit when cash is collected. The tax base of any receivable with respect to such revenues is nil, because the revenues do not affect taxable profit until cash is collected.

- (b) depreciation used when determining taxable profit (tax loss) may differ from that used when determining accounting surplus. The temporary difference is the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its tax base, which is the original cost of the asset less all deductions in respect of that asset permitted by the taxation authorities when determining taxable profit of the current and prior periods. A taxable temporary difference arises and results in a deferred tax liability when tax depreciation is accelerated. If the tax depreciation is less rapid than the accounting depreciation, a deductible temporary difference arises, resulting in a deferred tax asset (see paragraph D8.17).

Deductible temporary differences

- D8.17 A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless the deferred tax asset arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that:

- (a) is not a business combination; and

- (b) at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting surplus nor taxable profit (tax loss).

However, for deductible temporary differences associated with investments in controlled entities, branches and associates, and for interests in joint arrangements, a deferred tax asset shall be recognised in accordance with paragraph D8.29.

- D8.18 In applying paragraph D8.17, an NPO considers whether tax law restricts the sources of taxable profits against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.

- D8.19 The following are examples of deductible temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets:

- (a) retirement benefit costs may be deducted when determining an accounting surplus at the time that the service is provided by the employee but deducted when determining taxable profit, either when contributions are paid to a fund by the NPO or when retirement benefits are paid by the NPO. A temporary difference exists between the carrying amount of the liability and its tax base; the tax base of the liability is usually nil. Such a deductible temporary difference results in a deferred tax asset because economic benefits will flow to the NPO in the form of a deduction from taxable profits when contributions or retirement benefits are paid.

- (b) certain assets may be carried at fair value, without an equivalent adjustment being made for tax purposes. A deductible temporary difference arises if the tax base of the asset exceeds its carrying amount.

- The reversal of deductible temporary differences results in deductions when taxable profits of future periods are determined. It is probable that taxable profit will be available against which a deductible temporary difference can be utilised when there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity that are expected to reverse:

- (a) in the same period as the expected reversal of the deductible temporary difference; or

- (b) in periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward.

In such circumstances, the deferred tax asset is recognised in the period in which the deductible temporary differences arise.

- D8.21 When there are insufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, the deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that:

- (a) it is probable that the NPO will have sufficient taxable profit relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity in the same period as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference (or in the periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax asset can be carried back or forward). When evaluating whether it will have sufficient taxable profit in future periods, an NPO:

- (i) compares the deductible temporary differences with future taxable profit that excludes tax deductions resulting from the reversal of those deductible temporary differences. This comparison shows the extent to which the future taxable profit is sufficient for the NPO to deduct the amounts resulting from the reversal of those deductible temporary differences.

- (ii) ignores taxable amounts arising from deductible temporary differences that are expected to originate in future periods, because the deferred tax asset arising from those deductible temporary differences will itself require future taxable profit in order to be utilised.

- (b) tax planning opportunities are available to the NPO that will create taxable profit in appropriate periods.

- D8.22 The estimate of probable future taxable profit might include the recovery of some of an NPO’s assets for more than their carrying amount if there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the NPO will achieve this.

- D8.23 When an NPO has a history of recent losses, the NPO considers the guidance in paragraphs D8.24–D8.25.

Unused tax losses and unused tax credits

- D8.24 A deferred tax asset shall be recognised for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised. When assessing the probability that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised, an NPO considers the following criteria:

- (a) whether the NPO has sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, which will result in taxable amounts against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised before they expire;

- (b) whether it is probable that the NPO will have taxable profits before the unused tax losses or unused tax credits expire;

- (c) whether the unused tax losses result from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur; and

- (d) whether tax planning opportunities are available to the NPO that will create taxable profit in the period in which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised.

To the extent that it is not probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised, the deferred tax asset is not recognised.

- The existence of unused tax losses is strong evidence that future taxable profit may not be available. Consequently, when an NPO has a history of recent losses, the NPO recognises a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits only to the extent that the NPO has sufficient taxable temporary differences or to the extent that there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or unused tax credits can be utilised by the NPO.

Reassessment of unrecognised deferred tax assets

- D8.26 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO reassesses any unrecognised deferred tax assets. The NPO recognises a previously unrecognised deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Investments in controlled entities, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements

- Temporary differences arise when the carrying amount of investments in controlled entities, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements (for example, in the controlling NPO’s consolidated financial statements, the carrying amount of a controlled entity is the net consolidated assets of that controlled entity, including the carrying amount of any related goodwill) becomes different from the tax base (which is often cost) of the investment or interest. Such differences may arise in a number of different circumstances. For example:

- (a) the existence of undistributed surpluses of controlled entities, branches, associates and joint arrangements;

- (b) changes in foreign exchange rates when a controlling NPO and its controlled entity are based in different countries; and

- (c) a reduction in the carrying amount of an investment in an associate to its recoverable amount.

Investments may be accounted for differently in the controlling NPO’s separate financial statements compared to the consolidated financial statements, in which case the temporary difference associated with that investment may also differ. For example, in the controlling NPO’s separate financial statements, the carrying amount of a controlled entity will depend on the accounting policy chosen in paragraph G1.47.

- D8.28 An NPO shall recognise a deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in controlled entities, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

- (a) the controlling NPO, investor or party to the joint arrangement is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and

- (b) it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

- D8.29 An NPO shall recognise a deferred tax asset for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in controlled entities, branches and associates and interests in joint arrangements, only to the extent that it is probable that:

- (a) the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future; and

- (b) taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

Measurement of deferred tax

- D8.30 An NPO shall measure a deferred tax liability (asset) using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. An NPO shall regard tax rates and tax laws as substantively enacted when the remaining steps in the enactment process have not affected the outcome in the past and are unlikely to do so.

- D8.31 When different tax rates apply to different levels of taxable profit, an NPO shall measure deferred tax liabilities (assets) using the average enacted or substantively enacted rates that it expects to be applicable to the taxable profit (tax loss) of the periods in which it expects the deferred tax liability to be settled (deferred tax asset to be realised).

- D8.32 The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets shall reflect the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the NPO expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related assets and liabilities. Consequently, an NPO measures deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets using the tax rate and the tax

base that are consistent with the expected manner of recovery or settlement. For example, if the temporary difference arises from an item of income that is expected to be taxable as a capital gain in a future period, the deferred tax expense is measured using the capital gain tax rate and the tax base that is consistent with recovering the carrying amount through sale.

- If a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset arises from a non-depreciable asset measured using the revaluation model in E2, the measurement of the deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the non- depreciable asset through sale. If a deferred tax liability or asset arises from investment property that is measured at fair value, there is a rebuttable presumption that the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through sale. Accordingly, unless the presumption is rebutted, the measurement of the deferred tax liability or the deferred tax asset shall reflect the tax consequences of recovering the carrying amount of the investment property entirely through sale. This presumption is rebutted if the investment property is depreciable and is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, instead of through sale. If the presumption is rebutted, the requirements of paragraph D8.32 shall be followed.

- The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset shall be reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An NPO shall reduce the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that recognised deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction shall be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.

Measurement of both current and deferred tax

- D8.35 An NPO shall not discount current or deferred tax assets and liabilities.

- D8.36 In some jurisdictions, income tax is payable at a higher or lower rate if part or all of the profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity. In other jurisdictions, income tax may be refundable or payable if part or all of the profit or retained earnings is paid out as a dividend to shareholders of the entity. In both of those circumstances, an NPO shall measure current and deferred tax at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits until the NPO recognises a liability to make a capital distribution. When the NPO recognises a liability to make a capital distribution, it shall recognise the resulting current or deferred tax liability (asset) and the related tax expense (income).

Withholding tax on distributions

- D8.37 When an NPO makes a capital distribution, it may be required to pay a portion of the distribution to taxation authorities on behalf of holders of equity claims. Such an amount paid or payable to taxation authorities is charged to net assets as a part of the capital distribution.

Uncertainty over income tax treatments

- D8.38 It might not be clear how tax law applies to a particular transaction or circumstance. An uncertain tax treatment is a tax treatment whose acceptability by the relevant taxation authority under tax law is uncertain.

- D8.39 An NPO shall determine whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more other uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.

- D8.40 An NPO shall assume that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making those examinations. If an NPO concludes that it is:

- (a) probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the NPO shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be used in its income tax filings; or

- (b) not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the NPO shall reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates by using either of the following methods, depending on which better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty:

- (i) the most likely amount – the single most likely amount in a range of possible outcomes; or

- (ii) the expected value – the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes.

- An NPO shall reflect the effect of a change in relevant facts and circumstances, or of new information, on its judgements or estimates about uncertain tax treatments as a change in accounting estimate by applying B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors.

Presentation

Allocation in income and net assets

- D8.42 An NPO shall recognise tax expense in the same component as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense (ie surplus or loss from continuing operations or discontinued operations, or income and expenses recognised directly in net assets).

Current/non-current distinction

- D8.43 When an NPO presents current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities as separate classifications in its Statement of Financial Position, it shall not classify any deferred tax assets (liabilities) as current assets (liabilities).

Offsetting

- D8.44 An NPO shall offset current tax assets and current tax liabilities if, and only if, it has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and the NPO intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

- D8.45 An NPO shall offset deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities if, and only if:

- (a) it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and

- the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:

- (i) the same taxable entity; or

- (ii) different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Disclosures

- D8.46 An NPO shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effect of the current and deferred tax consequences of recognised transactions and other events (including the enactment or substantive enactment of tax rates and tax laws such as Pillar Two legislation).

- D8.47 An NPO shall disclose separately the major components of tax expense (income). Such components of tax expense (income) may include:

- (a) current tax expense (income);

- (b) any adjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods;

- (c) the amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to the origination and reversal of temporary differences;

- (d) the amount of deferred tax expense (income) relating to changes in tax rates or the imposition of new taxes;

- (e) the amount of the benefit arising from a previously unrecognised tax loss, tax credit or temporary difference of a prior period that is used to reduce tax expense;

- (f) adjustments to deferred tax expense (income) arising from a change in the tax status of the NPO or its holders of equity claims;

- (g) deferred tax expense (income) arising from the write-down, or reversal of a previous write-down, of a deferred tax asset in accordance with paragraph D8.34; and

- (h) the amount of tax expense (income) relating to those changes in accounting policies and errors that are included in surplus or deficit in accordance with B7, because they cannot be accounted for retrospectively.

- D8.48 An NPO shall disclose the following separately:

- (a) the aggregate current and deferred tax relating to items that are recognised directly in net assets.

- (b) the aggregate current and deferred tax relating to items that are charged or credited directly to net assets.

- (c) an explanation of any significant differences between the tax expense (income) and accounting surplus multiplied by the applicable tax rate. For example, such differences may arise from transactions such as revenue that are exempt from taxation or expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit (tax loss).

- (d) an explanation of changes in the applicable tax rate(s) compared with the previous reporting period.

- (e) for each type of temporary difference and for each type of unused tax losses and tax credits:

- (i) the amount of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets at the end of the reporting period; and

- (ii) an analysis of the change in deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets during the period.

- (f) the amount (and expiry date, if any) of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.

- (g) in the circumstances described in paragraph D8.36, an explanation of the nature of the potential income tax consequences that would result from making a distribution to the providers of contributed capital.

International tax reform – Pillar Two model rules

- D8.49 An NPO within the scope of Pillar Two legislation shall disclose that it has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes (see paragraph D8.4).

- D8.50 An NPO shall disclose separately its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income taxes.

E1 – Inventories

Scope of this Section

- E1.1 This Section sets out the principles for recognising and measuring inventories. Inventories are assets:

- (a) held for sale in the ordinary course of operations;

- (b) held for distribution to service recipients in the ordinary course of operations;

- (c) held for use in fundraising (or similar circumstances where the items will be transferred to another party in the course of the NPO’s fundraising activities – for example, prizes);

- (d) in the process of production for such sale or distribution; or

- (e) in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services.

- E1.2 This Section applies to all inventories, except:

- (a) financial instruments (see F1 Financial instruments); and

- (b) biological assets related to agricultural activity and agricultural produce at the point of harvest (see E6 Specialised activities).

- E1.3 The disclosure requirements in this Section apply to return assets classified as inventory (see paragraph AC1.21(c). Return assets are recognised and measured in accordance with paragraphs AC1.20–AC1.24 and not in accordance with this Section.

- This Section does not apply to the measurement of inventories held by producers of agricultural and forest products, agricultural produce after harvest and minerals and mineral products, to the extent that they are measured at fair value less costs to sell through surplus or deficit.

Recognition of inventories

- E1.5 An NPO shall recognise all inventories within the scope of this Section unless it has elected to apply one or more of the following permitted exceptions in respect of those inventories:

- (a) low-value items donated to the NPO for resale or to be transferred to another party in the course of the NPO’s fundraising activities, recognised as revenue when the items are sold or fundraising activity takes place, in accordance with paragraph C1.64(a);

- (b) low-value items donated to the NPO for distribution to service recipients or for the NPO’s own use, recognised as revenue and an expense when the items are distributed or used in accordance with paragraph C1.64(b);

- (c) work in progress that comprises services in kind donated to the NPO that are not recognised as revenue, an asset or an expense in accordance with paragraph C1.64(c); and

- (d) work in progress that comprises services to be provided for no or nominal consideration and the NPO elects to expense the costs as they are incurred.

- E1.6 When applying a permitted exception, the NPO shall apply that exception to all items within a class of inventories.

Measurement of inventories

Measurement principles

- E1.7 An NPO shall measure inventories at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell, except where paragraph E1.8 or paragraph E1.9 applies.

- E1.8 Where inventories are acquired through a donation, their initial cost shall be measured at fair value in accordance with paragraph C1.62.

- E1.9 Inventories held:

- (a) for distribution at no or nominal consideration; or

- (b) for use by the NPO in meeting its objectives

shall be measured at the lower of cost (or deemed cost for donated inventories in accordance with paragraph E1.8), adjusted for any loss of service potential and replacement cost.

Cost of inventories

- E1.10 An NPO shall include in the cost of inventories all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Costs of purchase

- E1.11 The costs of purchase of inventories comprise the purchase price, import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the NPO from the taxing authorities) and transport, handling and other costs directly attributable to the acquisition of finished goods, materials and services. Trade discounts, rebates and other similar items are deducted in determining the costs of purchase.

- An NPO may purchase inventories on deferred settlement terms. In some cases, the arrangement effectively contains an unstated financing element – for example, a difference between the purchase price for normal credit terms and the deferred settlement amount. In these cases, the difference is recognised as interest expense over the period of the financing and is not added to the cost of the inventories.

Costs of conversion

- E1.13 The costs of conversion of inventories include costs directly related to the units of production, such as direct labour. They also include a systematic allocation of fixed and variable production overheads that are incurred in converting materials into finished goods. Fixed production overheads are those indirect costs of production that remain relatively constant regardless of the volume of production, such as depreciation and maintenance of factory buildings and equipment and the cost of factory management and administration. Variable production overheads are those indirect costs of production that vary directly, or nearly directly, with the volume of production, such as indirect materials and indirect labour.

Allocation of production overheads

- An NPO shall allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion on the basis of the normal capacity of the production facilities. Normal capacity is the production expected to be achieved on average over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances, taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance. The actual level of production may be used if it approximates normal capacity. The amount of fixed overhead

allocated to each unit of production is not increased as a consequence of low production or idle plant. Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. In periods of abnormally high production, the amount of fixed overhead allocated to each unit of production is decreased so that inventories are not measured above cost. Variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production on the basis of the actual use of the production facilities.

Joint products and by-products

- A production process may result in more than one product being produced simultaneously. This is the case, for example, when joint products are produced or when there is a main product and a by-product. When the costs of raw materials or conversion of each product are not separately identifiable, an NPO shall allocate them between the products on a rational and consistent basis. The allocation may be based, for example, on the relative sales value of each product either at the stage in the production process when the products become separately identifiable or at the completion of production. Most by-products, by their nature, are immaterial. When this is the case, the NPO shall measure them at selling price less costs to complete and sell and deduct this amount from the cost of the main product. As a result, the carrying amount of the main product is not materially different from its cost.

Other costs included in inventories

- E1.16 An NPO shall include other costs in the cost of inventories only to the extent that they are incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

- E1.17 An NPO applying paragraph F1.68(b) adjusts the carrying amount of a commodity (hedged item) held for the change in the fair value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk.

Costs excluded from inventories

- E1.18 Examples of costs excluded from the cost of inventories and recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred are:

- (a) abnormal amounts of wasted materials, labour or other production costs;

- (b) storage costs, unless those costs are necessary during the production process before a further production stage;

- (c) administrative overheads that do not contribute to bringing inventories to their present location and condition; and

- (d) selling costs.

Cost of inventories of a service provider

- To the extent that service providers have inventories, they measure them at the costs of their production. These costs consist primarily of the labour and other costs of personnel directly engaged in providing the service, including supervisory personnel and attributable overheads. Labour and other costs relating to sales and general administrative personnel are not included but are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. The cost of inventories of a service provider does not include profit margins or non-attributable overheads that are often factored into prices charged by service providers.

Cost of agricultural produce harvested from biological assets

- E6 requires that inventories comprising agricultural produce that an NPO has harvested from its biological assets shall be measured on initial recognition at their fair value less estimated costs to sell at the point of harvest. This becomes the cost of the inventories at that date for application of this Section.

Techniques for measuring cost, such as standard costing, retail method and most recent purchase price

- An NPO may use techniques such as the standard cost method, the retail method or most recent purchase price for measuring the cost of inventories if the result approximates cost. Standard costs take into account normal levels of materials and supplies, labour, efficiency and capacity utilisation. They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, revised in the light of current conditions. The retail method measures cost by reducing the sales value of the inventory by the appropriate percentage gross margin.

Cost formulas

- E1.22 An NPO shall measure the cost of inventories of items that are not ordinarily interchangeable, and goods or services produced and segregated for specific projects by using specific identification of their individual costs.

- An NPO shall measure the cost of inventories, other than those dealt with in paragraph E1.22, by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula. An NPO shall use the same cost formula for all inventories having a similar nature and use to the NPO. For inventories with a different nature or use, different cost formulas may be justified. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is not permitted by INPAS.

Impairment of inventories

- E1.24 Paragraphs E5.2–E5.6 require an NPO to assess at the end of each reporting period whether any inventories are impaired – that is the carrying amount is not fully recoverable (for example, because of damage, obsolescence or declining selling prices). If an item (or group of items) of inventory is impaired, those paragraphs require the NPO to measure the inventory at its selling price less costs to complete and sell (or for inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration or for use by the NPO in delivering its objectives, the cost adjusted for any loss of service potential or replacement cost) and to recognise an impairment loss. Those paragraphs also require a reversal of a prior impairment in some circumstances.

Recognition as an expense

- E1.25 When inventories are sold, distributed to service recipients or used by the NPO, the NPO shall recognise the carrying amount of those inventories as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised.

- E1.26 Some inventories may be allocated to other asset accounts – for example, inventory used as a component of self-constructed property, plant or equipment. Inventories allocated to another asset in this way are accounted for subsequently in accordance with the section of INPAS relevant to that type of asset.

Disclosures

- E1.27 An NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the accounting policies adopted in measuring inventories, including the cost formula used;

- (b) the total carrying amount of inventories and the carrying amount in classifications appropriate to the NPO;

- (c) the amount of inventories recognised as an expense during the period;

- (d) impairment losses recognised or reversed in surplus or deficit in accordance with E5; and

- (e) the total carrying amount of inventories pledged as security for liabilities.

- E1.28 When an NPO receives inventories from donations in kind but does not recognise those donations in kind on receipt, the NPO shall disclose the information required by paragraph C1.107.

- E1.29 When an NPO does not recognise as inventories work in progress that comprises services to be provided for no or nominal consideration because the NPO elects to expense the costs as they are incurred, the NPO shall disclose a description of the services to be provided and their significance to the NPO.

Application Guidance E1 – Inventories

Measurement

Fair value

- AE1.1 Guidance in determining fair value is found in A4 Fair value measurement. The Application Guidance for A4 addresses the fair value measurement of donations in kind, which includes donated inventories. An NPO shall apply the fair value hierarchy established in A4 in determining the fair value of donated inventories.

Loss of service potential

- AE1.2 Where an NPO decides to recognise inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration or for use by the NPO in delivering its objectives, after initial recognition, its measurement must take into account any loss of service potential.

- AE1.3 The service potential of the inventories takes into account the current age, functionality and condition of the inventories held by the NPO.

- AE1.4 In order to reflect the current age, functionality and condition of the inventories, the following factors are considered:

- (a) physical obsolescence: this relates to any loss of service potential due to the physical deterioration of the inventories resulting from physical damage or age;

- (b) functional obsolescence: this relates to any loss of service potential resulting from inefficiencies in the inventories that are being valued compared with its modern equivalent; and

- (c) economic obsolescence: this relates to any loss of utility caused by economic or other factors outside the control of the NPO.

Reliable measurement

- AE1.5 Paragraph A2.95 states that for an asset to be recognised, it must be measured. Where an asset cannot be reliably measured, it is not recognised.

- AE1.6 It is expected that the majority of donated inventories can be measured reliably. There may be rare circumstances where an NPO is unable to reliably measure inventories – for example, where an NPO responding to an emergency receives large volumes of donated items, distributes them almost immediately and does not have the systems or resources to keep accurate records without delaying the response to the emergency.

- AE1.7 In these circumstances, it will not be possible for the NPO to apply a permitted exception (paragraph E1.5) to those inventories. This is because it will not be possible to reliably measure the asset and the related revenue and expense that are all required to be recognised when the items are used or distributed (see paragraph C1.64(b)). In these circumstances, the NPO shall not recognise inventories in respect of these donated items. Instead, the NPO shall make the disclosure required by paragraph E1.28.

E2 – Property, plant and equipment

Scope of this Section

- This Section applies to accounting for property, plant and equipment and accounting for investment property whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort on an ongoing basis. E3 Investment property applies to investment property whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort. This Section includes property that might otherwise be considered investment property, as the primary purpose of the asset is to deliver an NPO’s missional objectives (for example, social housing) rather than its commercial returns.

- E2.2 Property, plant and equipment are tangible assets that:

- (a) are held for use in the ordinary activities of the NPO, for rental to others or for the NPO‘s administrative purposes; and

- (b) are expected to be used during more than one period.

- E2.3 Property, plant and equipment does not include:

- (a) biological assets related to agricultural activity (see E6 Specialised activities). However, this Section applies to bearer plants that, at initial recognition, can be measured both initially and on an ongoing basis separately from the produce on them without undue cost or effort. This section applies to such bearer plants but not to the produce on those bearer plants; and

- (b) mineral rights and mineral reserves, such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.

Recognition

- E2.4 An NPO shall recognise the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment as an asset if, and only if:

- (a) it is probable that economic benefits or service potential associated with the item will flow to the NPO; and

- (b) the cost of the item can be measured reliably.

- E2.5 Items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment are recognised in accordance with this Section when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment. Otherwise, such items are classified as inventory.

- Parts of some items of property, plant and equipment may require replacement at regular intervals (for example, the roof of a building). An NPO shall add to the carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost is incurred if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental future benefit or service potential to the NPO. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced is derecognised in accordance with paragraphs E2.32–E2.35 regardless of whether the replaced parts had been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable for an NPO to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the NPO may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. Paragraph E2.21 provides that if the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits or service potential, an

NPO shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and depreciate each such component separately over its useful life.

- A condition of continuing to operate an item of property, plant and equipment (for example, a bus) may be performing regular major inspections for faults regardless of whether parts of the item are replaced. When each major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the item of property, plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous major inspection (as distinct from physical parts) is derecognised. This is done regardless of whether the cost of the previous major inspection was identified in the transaction in which the item was acquired or constructed. If necessary, the estimated cost of a future similar inspection may be used as an indication of what the cost of the existing inspection component was when the item was acquired or constructed.

- E2.8 Land and buildings are separable assets and an NPO shall account for them separately, even when they are acquired together.

Measurement at initial recognition

- E2.9 An NPO shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment that has been acquired or constructed at initial recognition at its cost.

- An NPO shall measure the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment that has been donated at its fair value in line with the guidance in A4 Fair value measurement. Application of fair value on initial recognition shall be the deemed cost of the asset.

Elements of cost

- E2.11 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises all of the following:

- (a) its purchase price, including legal and brokerage fees, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates.

- (b) any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These can include the costs of site preparation, initial delivery and handling, installation and assembly and testing of functionality.

- (c) the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an NPO incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.

- E2.12 The following costs are not costs of an item of property, plant and equipment and an NPO shall recognise them as an expense when they are incurred:

- (a) costs of opening a new facility;

- (b) costs of introducing a new service or product (including costs of advertising and promotional activities);

- (c) costs of conducting operations in a new location or with a new class of service recipient or customer (including costs of staff training);

- (d) administration and other general overhead costs; and

- (e) borrowing costs (see D7 Borrowing costs).

- E2.13 The income and related expenses of incidental operations during construction or development of an item of property, plant and equipment are recognised in surplus or deficit if those operations are not necessary to bring the item to its intended location and operating condition.

Measurement of cost

- E2.14 The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is the cash price equivalent at the recognition date. If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future payments.

Exchanges of assets

- E2.15 An item of property, plant or equipment may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset, or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. An NPO shall measure the cost of the acquired asset at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that case, the asset’s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

Measurement after initial recognition

- An NPO shall choose either the cost model in paragraph E2.17 or the revaluation model in paragraph E2.18 as its accounting policy and shall apply that policy to an entire class of property, plant and equipment. An NPO shall apply the cost model to investment property whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort. An NPO shall recognise the costs of day-to-day servicing of an item of property, plant and equipment in surplus or deficit in the period in which the costs are incurred.

Cost model

- E2.17 An NPO shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment after initial recognition at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Revaluation model

- E2.18 An NPO shall measure an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations shall be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period. A4 provides guidance on determining fair value. If an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant and equipment to which that asset belongs shall be revalued.

- E2.19 If an asset’s carrying amount is increased as a result of a revaluation, the increase shall be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets and accumulated under the heading of revaluation surplus. However, the increase shall be recognised in surplus or deficit to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in surplus or deficit.

- E2.20 If an asset’s carrying amount is decreased as a result of a revaluation, the decrease shall be recognised in surplus or deficit. However, the decrease shall be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets to the extent of any credit balance existing in the revaluation surplus in respect of that asset. The decrease recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets reduces the amount accumulated under the heading of revaluation surplus.

Depreciation

- E2.21 If the major components of an item of property, plant and equipment have significantly different patterns of consumption of economic benefits or service potential, an NPO shall allocate the initial cost of the asset to its major components and depreciate each such component separately over its useful life. Other assets shall be depreciated over their useful lives as a single asset. With some exceptions, such as quarries and sites used for landfill, land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.

- E2.22 The depreciation charge for each period shall be recognised in surplus or deficit unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset. For example, the depreciation of manufacturing property, plant and equipment is included in the costs of inventories (see E1 Inventories).

Depreciable amount and depreciation period

- E2.23 An NPO shall allocate the depreciable amount of an asset on a systematic basis over its useful life.

- E2.24 Factors such as a change in how an asset is used, significant unexpected wear and tear, technological advancement and changes in market prices may indicate that the residual value or useful life of an asset has changed since the most recent annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, an NPO shall review its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend the residual value, depreciation method or useful life. The NPO shall account for the change in residual value, depreciation method or useful life as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs B7.18–B7.21.

- E2.25 Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use – that is when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognised. Depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless the asset is fully depreciated. However, under usage methods of depreciation, the depreciation charge can be zero while there is no production.

- E2.26 An NPO shall consider all the following factors in determining the useful life of an asset:

- (a) the expected usage of the asset. Usage is assessed by reference to the asset’s expected capacity or physical output.

- (b) expected physical wear and tear, which depends on operational factors such as the number of shifts for which the asset is to be used and the repair and maintenance programme, and the care and maintenance of the asset while idle.

- (c) technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in usage, or from a change in the market demand for the service or product output of the asset. Expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technical or commercial obsolescence of the asset.

- (d) legal or similar limits on the use of the asset, such as the expiry dates of related leases.

Depreciable method

- E2.27 An NPO shall select a depreciation method that reflects the pattern in which it expects to consume the asset’s future economic benefits or service potential. The possible depreciation methods include the straight-line method, the diminishing balance method and a method

based on usage such as the units of production method. A depreciation method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.

- E2.28 If there is an indication that there has been a significant change since the last annual reporting date in the pattern by which an NPO expects to consume an asset’s future economic benefits or service potential, the NPO shall review its present depreciation method and, if current expectations differ, change the depreciation method to reflect the new pattern. The NPO shall account for the change as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with paragraphs B7.18–B7.21.

Impairment

Recognition and measurement of impairment

- At each reporting date, an NPO shall apply E5 Impairment of assets to determine whether an item or group of items of property, plant and equipment is impaired and, if so, how to recognise and measure the impairment loss. That Section explains when and how an NPO reviews the carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset, and when it recognises or reverses an impairment loss.

Compensation for impairment

- E2.30 An NPO shall include in surplus or deficit compensation from third parties for items of property, plant and equipment that were impaired, lost or given up only when the compensation becomes receivable.

Property, plant and equipment held for sale

- E2.31 Paragraph E5.11(f) states that a plan to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date is an indicator of impairment that triggers the calculation of the asset’s recoverable amount for the purpose of determining whether the asset is impaired.

Derecognition

- E2.32 An NPO shall derecognise an item of property, plant and equipment:

- (a) on disposal; or

- (b) when no future economic benefits or service potential are expected from its use or disposal.

- E2.33 An NPO shall recognise the gain or loss on the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment in surplus or deficit when the item is derecognised (unless D6 Leases requires otherwise on a sale and leaseback). The NPO shall not classify such gains as revenue.

- E2.34 The date of disposal of an item is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs C1.168–C1.172 for determining when a promise is satisfied. D6 applies to disposal by a sale and leaseback.

- E2.35 An NPO shall determine the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the item.

Disclosures

- E2.36 An NPO shall disclose the following for each class of property, plant and equipment determined in accordance with paragraph B2.12(a) and separately for investment property carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment:

- (a) the measurement bases used for determining the gross carrying amount;

- (b) the depreciation methods used;

- (c) the useful lives or the depreciation rates used;

- (d) the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the reporting period; and

- (e) a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the reporting period showing separately:

- (i) additions;

- (ii) disposals;

- (iii) acquisitions through business combinations;

- (iv) increases or decreases resulting from revaluations under paragraphs E2.18–E2.20 and from impairment losses recognised or reversed in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets in accordance with E5;

- (v) transfers to and from investment property carried at fair value through surplus or deficit (see paragraph E3.11);

- (vi) impairment losses recognised or reversed in surplus or deficit in accordance with E5;

- (vii) depreciation; and

- (viii) other changes.

This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.

- E2.37 An NPO shall also disclose the following:

- (a) the existence and carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment to which the NPO has restricted title or that is pledged as security for liabilities;

- (b) the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment;

- (c) if an NPO has investment property whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, it shall disclose that fact and the reasons why fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort for those items of investment property; and

- (d) the aggregate gross book value, accumulated depreciation and net book value of property, plant and equipment whose use is restricted by donors or grantors to specified activities.

- E2.38 If items of property, plant and equipment are stated at revalued amounts, an NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the effective date of the revaluation;

- (b) whether an independent valuer was involved;

- (c) for each revalued class of property, plant and equipment, the carrying amount that would have been recognised had the assets been carried under the cost model; and

- (d) the revaluation surplus, indicating the change for the period and any restrictions on the distribution of the balance.

E3 – Investment property

Scope of this Section

- This Section applies to accounting for investments in land or buildings that meet the definition of investment property in paragraph E3.2 and some property interests held by a lessee under an operating lease (see paragraph E3.4) that are treated like investment property. Only investment property whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort on an ongoing basis is accounted for in accordance with this Section at fair value through surplus or deficit. All other investment property is accounted for using the cost model in E2 Property, plant and equipment and remains within the scope of E2 unless a reliable measure of fair value becomes available and it is expected that fair value will be reliably measurable on an ongoing basis.

Definition and initial recognition of investment property

- E3.2 Investment property is property (land or a building, or part of a building, or both) held by the owner or by the lessee under a finance lease to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, instead of for:

- (a) use in the ordinary activities of the NPO, or for the NPO’s administrative purposes; or (b) sale where this is in the ordinary course of the NPO’s activity.

- E3.3 A property held by an NPO primarily for activities to deliver its missional objectives and which also generates cash inflows – for example, social housing – shall not be classified as an investment property. Instead it shall be accounted for as property, plant, and equipment in accordance with E2.

- A property interest that is held by a lessee under an operating lease may be classified and accounted for as investment property using this Section if, and only if, the property would otherwise meet the definition of an investment property and the lessee can measure the fair value of the property interest without undue cost or effort on an ongoing basis. This classification alternative is available on a property-by-property basis.

- E3.5 An NPO shall use its judgement to determine whether the acquisition of investment property is the acquisition of an asset or of a group of assets, or a business combination within the scope of G4 Business combinations and goodwill. Determining whether a specific transaction meets the definition of a business combination as defined in G4 and includes an investment property as defined in this Section requires the separate application of both sections.

- Mixed use property shall be separated between investment property and property, plant and equipment. However, if the fair value of the investment property component cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the entire property shall be accounted for as property, plant and equipment in accordance with E2.

Measurement at initial recognition

- E3.7 An NPO shall measure purchased investment property at its cost at initial recognition. The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable expenditure such as legal and brokerage fees, property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. If payment is deferred beyond normal credit terms, the cost is the present value of all future payments. An NPO shall determine the cost of a self-constructed investment property in accordance with paragraphs E2.11–E2.15.

- E3.8 An NPO shall measure donated investment property at fair value in accordance with A4 Fair value measurement. The fair value determined on initial recognition shall be the deemed cost of the investment property.

- E3.9 The initial cost of a property interest held under a lease and classified as an investment property shall be as prescribed for a finance lease by paragraph D6.9, even if the lease would otherwise be classified as an operating lease if it was in the scope of D6 Leases. In other words, the asset is recognised at the lower of the fair value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. An equivalent amount is recognised as a liability in accordance with paragraph D6.9.

Measurement after initial recognition

- E3.10 Investment property whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit. If a property interest held under a lease is classified as investment property, the item accounted for at fair value is that interest and not the underlying property. A4 provides guidance on determining fair value. An NPO shall account for all other investment property using the cost model in E2.

Transfers

- E3.11 If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or effort for an item of investment property measured using the fair value model, the NPO shall thereafter account for that item in accordance with E2 until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available. The carrying amount of the investment property on that date becomes its cost under E2. Paragraph E3.13(d)(iii) requires disclosure of this change. It is a change of circumstances and not a change in accounting policy.

- Other than as required by paragraph E3.11, an NPO shall transfer a property to, or from, investment property only when there is a change in use. A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of investment property and there is evidence of the change in use.

Disclosures

- E3.13 An NPO shall disclose the following for all investment property accounted for at fair value through surplus or deficit (paragraph E3.10):

- (a) the extent to which the fair value of investment property (as measured or disclosed in the financial statements) is based on a valuation by an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent experience in the location and class of the investment property being valued. If there has been no such valuation, that fact shall be disclosed.

- (b) the existence and amounts of restrictions on the realisability of investment property or the remittance of income and proceeds of disposal.

- (c) contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop investment property or for repairs, maintenance or enhancements.

- (d) a reconciliation between the carrying amounts of investment property at the beginning and end of the period, showing separately:

- (i) additions, disclosing separately those additions resulting from acquisitions through business combinations;

- (ii) net gains or losses from fair value adjustments;

- (iii) transfers to and from investment property carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment (see paragraph E3.11);

- (iv) transfers to and from inventories and owner-occupied property; and

- (v) other changes.

This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.

- E3.14 In accordance with D6, the owner of an investment property provides lessors’ disclosures about leases into which it has entered. An NPO that holds an investment property under a finance lease or operating lease provides lessees’ disclosures for finance leases and lessors’ disclosures for any operating leases into which it has entered.

E4 – Intangible assets other than goodwill

Scope of this Section

- E4.1 This Section applies to accounting for all intangible assets other than goodwill (see G4 Business combinations and goodwill) and intangible assets held by an NPO for sale in the ordinary course of business (see E1 Inventories and C1 Revenue).

- E4.2 An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. Such an asset is identifiable when:

- (a) it is separable – that is, it is capable of being separated or divided from the NPO and sold, transferred, licenced, rented or exchanged, either individually or together with a related contract, asset or liability; or

- (b) it arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the NPO or from other rights and obligations.

- E4.3 This Section does not apply to the following:

(a) financial assets; or

- (b) mineral rights and mineral reserves such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources.

Recognition

General principle for recognising intangible assets

- E4.4 An NPO shall recognise an intangible asset as an asset if, and only if:

- (a) it is probable that the future expected economic benefit or service potential that are attributable to the asset will flow to the NPO;

- (b) the cost or value of the asset can be measured reliably; and

- (c) the asset does not result from expenditure incurred internally on an intangible item.5

- E4.5 An NPO shall assess the probability of expected future economic benefit or service potential using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management’s best estimate of the economic conditions that will exist over the useful life of the asset.

- An NPO uses judgement to assess the degree of certainty attached to the flow of future economic benefits or service potential that are attributable to the use of the asset on the basis of the evidence available at the time of initial recognition, giving greater weight to external evidence.

- E4.7 The probability recognition criterion in paragraph E4.4(a) is always considered satisfied for intangible assets that are separately acquired.

Acquisition as part of a business combination

- E4.8 An intangible asset acquired in a business combination shall be recognised unless its fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date.

- 5 This Section uses the term ‘asset’ in a way that differs in some respects from the definition of an asset in paragraph A2.58 and the Glossary. For the purpose of this Section, an asset is a resource controlled by the NPO as a result of past events and from which economic benefit or service potential is expected to flow to the NPO.

- E4.9 An NPO shall measure an intangible asset initially at cost.

Separate acquisition

- E4.10 The cost of a separately acquired intangible asset comprises:

- (a) its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates; and

- (b) any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use.

Acquisition as part of a business combination

- E4.11 If an intangible asset is acquired in a business combination, the cost of that intangible asset is its fair value at the acquisition date.

Acquisition by way of grant or donation

- E4.12 If an intangible asset is acquired by way of a grant or donation, the cost shall be determined in accordance with A4 Fair value measurement. The fair value on initial recognition shall be the deemed cost of the asset.

Exchanges of assets

- E4.13 An intangible asset may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. An NPO shall measure the cost of such an intangible asset at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably measurable. In that case, the asset’s cost is measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

Internally generated assets

- An NPO shall recognise expenditure incurred internally on an intangible item, including all expenditure for both research and development activities, as an expense when it is incurred unless it forms part of the cost of another asset that meets the recognition criteria in this Standard.

- E4.15 As examples of applying the preceding paragraph, an NPO shall recognise expenditure on the following items as an expense and shall not recognise such expenditure as intangible assets:

- (a) internally generated brands, logos, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance;

- (b) start-up activities (that is, start-up costs), which include establishment costs such as legal and secretarial costs incurred in establishing a legal entity, expenditure to open a new facility or activity (that is, pre-opening costs) and expenditure for starting new operations or launching new products or processes (that is, pre-operating costs);

- (c) training activities;

- (d) advertising and promotional activities;

- (e) relocating or reorganising part or all of an NPO; and

- (f) internally generated goodwill.

- E4.16 Paragraph E4.15 does not preclude recognising a prepayment as an asset when payment for goods or services has been made in advance of the delivery of the goods or the rendering of the services.

Past expenses not to be recognised as an asset

- E4.17 Expenditure on an intangible item that was initially recognised as an expense shall not be recognised at a later date as part of the cost of an asset.

Measurement after recognition

- E4.18 An NPO shall measure intangible assets at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The requirements for amortisation are set out in this Section. The requirements for recognition of impairment are set out in E5 Impairment of assets.

Useful life

- E4.19 For the purpose of this Standard, all intangible assets shall be considered to have a finite useful life. The useful life of an intangible asset that arises from contractual or other legal rights shall not exceed the period of the contractual or other legal rights but may be shorter depending on the period over which the NPO expects to use the asset. If the contractual or other legal rights are conveyed for a limited term that can be renewed, the useful life of the intangible asset shall include the renewal period(s) only if there is evidence to support renewal by the NPO without significant cost.

- E4.20 If the useful life of an intangible asset cannot be established reliably, the life shall be determined based on management’s best estimate but shall not exceed ten years.

Amortisation period and amortisation method

- E4.21 An NPO shall allocate the depreciable amount of an intangible asset on a systematic basis over its useful life. The amortisation charge for each period shall be recognised as an expense, unless another section of this Standard requires the cost to be recognised as part of the cost of an asset such as inventories or property, plant and equipment.

- E4.22 Amortisation begins when the intangible asset is available for use – that is when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be usable in the manner intended by management. Amortisation ceases when the asset is derecognised. The NPO shall choose an amortisation method that reflects the pattern in which it expects to consume the asset’s economic benefit or service potential. If the NPO cannot determine that pattern reliably, it shall use the straight- line method.

- E4.23 There is a presumption that an amortisation method based on the revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset is inappropriate. However, an NPO may rebut this presumption and use an amortisation method based on revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset only in the limited circumstances:

- (a) in which the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue (that is when rights over the use of an intangible asset is specified as a fixed total amount of revenue to be generated); or

- (b) when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the intangible asset’s economic benefit or service potential are highly correlated.

Residual value

- E4.24 An NPO shall assume that the residual value of an intangible asset is zero unless:

- (a) there is a commitment by a third party to purchase the asset at the end of its useful life; or

(b) there is an active market for the asset and:

- (i) residual value can be determined by reference to that market; and

- it is probable that such a market will exist at the end of the asset’s useful life.

Review of amortisation period and amortisation method

- E4.25 Factors such as a change in how an intangible asset is used, technological advancement and changes in market prices may indicate that the residual value or useful life of an intangible asset has changed since the most recent annual reporting date. If such indicators are present, an NPO shall review its previous estimates and, if current expectations differ, amend the residual value, amortisation method or useful life. The NPO shall account for the change in residual value, amortisation method or useful life as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors.

Recoverability of the carrying amount – impairment losses

- E4.26 To determine whether an intangible asset is impaired, an NPO shall apply E5. That Section explains when and how an NPO reviews the carrying amount of its assets, how it determines the recoverable amount of an asset and when it recognises or reverses an impairment loss.

Retirements and disposals

- E4.27 An NPO shall derecognise an intangible asset and shall recognise a gain or loss in surplus or deficit:

- (a) on disposal; or

- (b) when no future economic benefit or service potential are expected from its use or disposal.

Disclosures

- E4.28 An NPO shall disclose the following for each class of intangible assets:

- (a) the useful lives or the amortisation rates used;

- (b) the amortisation methods used;

- (c) the gross carrying amount and any accumulated amortisation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the reporting period;

- the line item(s) in the Statement of Income and Expenses, in which any amortisation of intangible assets is included; and

- (e) a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the reporting period, showing separately:

- (i) additions;

- (ii) disposals;

- (iii) acquisitions through business combinations;

- (iv) amortisation;

- (v) impairment losses recognised or reversed in surplus or deficit in accordance with E5; and

- (vi) other changes.

This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.

- E4.29 An NPO shall also disclose:

- (a) a description, the carrying amount and remaining amortisation period of any individual intangible asset that is material to the NPO’s financial statements;

- (b) for intangible assets acquired by way of a grant and initially recognised at fair value (see paragraph E4.12):

- (i) the fair value initially recognised for these assets; and

- (ii) their carrying amounts.

- (c) the existence and carrying amounts of intangible assets to which the NPO has restricted title or that are pledged as security for liabilities; and

- (d) the amount of contractual commitments for the acquisition of intangible assets.

- E4.30 An NPO shall disclose the aggregate amount of research and development expenditure recognised as an expense during the period (that is the amount of expenditure incurred internally on research and development that has not been capitalised as part of the cost of another asset that meets the recognition criteria in this Standard).

E5 – Impairment of assets

Objective and scope

- E5.1 An impairment loss occurs when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. This Section shall be applied in accounting for the impairment of all assets other than the following, for which other sections of this Standard establish impairment requirements:

- (a) deferred tax assets (see D8 Income tax);

- (b) assets arising from employee benefits (see D4 Employee benefits);

- (c) financial assets within the scope of F1 Financial instruments;

- (d) investment property measured at fair value (see E3 Investment property);

- (e) biological assets related to agricultural activity measured at fair value less estimated costs to sell (see E6 Specialised activities); and

- (f) contract assets and assets arising from the costs of fulfilling a contract with a customer in accordance with paragraph C1.181.

Impairment of inventories

Measurement basis

- An NPO shall assess at each reporting date whether any inventories are impaired. The NPO shall make the assessment by comparing the carrying amount of each item of inventory (or group of similar items – see paragraph E5.5) with its selling price less costs to complete and sell. If an item of inventory (or group of similar items) is impaired, the NPO shall reduce the carrying amount of the inventory (or the group) to its selling price less costs to complete and sell. That reduction is an impairment loss, and it is recognised immediately in surplus or deficit.

- E5.3 For inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration, the cost adjusted for any loss of service potential (adjusted cost) shall be used instead of its selling price less costs to complete and sell. An NPO may refer to the replacement cost of an item in determining whether there has been a loss of service potential. If inventory held for distribution at no or nominal consideration is impaired, the NPO shall reduce the carrying amount to its adjusted cost.

- E5.4 Such reductions are an impairment loss, which is recognised immediately in surplus or deficit.

- E5.5 If it is impracticable to determine item by item the selling price less costs to complete and sell (for inventories held for sale) or, the adjusted cost (for inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration), , the NPO may group items of inventory relating to the same product line that have similar purposes or end uses and are produced and, where relevant, marketed in the same geographical area for the purpose of assessing impairment.

Reversal of impairment

- E5.6 An NPO shall make a new assessment of selling price less costs to complete and sell, or for inventories held for distribution at no or nominal consideration, adjusted cost at each subsequent reporting date. When the circumstances that previously caused inventories to be impaired no longer exist or when there is clear evidence of an increase in selling price less costs to complete and sell or adjusted cost because of changed economic circumstances, the NPO shall reverse the amount of the impairment (that is the reversal is limited to the amount

of the original impairment loss), so that the new carrying amount is the lower of the cost and the revised selling price less costs to complete and sell or adjusted cost.

Impairment of assets other than inventories

General principles

- If, and only if, the recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount, the NPO shall reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its recoverable amount. That reduction is an impairment loss. Paragraphs E5.13–E5.22 provide guidance on measuring the recoverable amount.

- An NPO shall recognise an impairment loss immediately in surplus or deficit, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with the revaluation model in E2 Property, plant and equipment. Any impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation decrease in accordance with paragraph E2.20.

- An NPO shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the NPO shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. If there is no indication of impairment, it is not necessary to estimate the recoverable amount.

Indicators of impairment

- E5.10 If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of the individual asset, an NPO shall estimate the recoverable amount of the operating unit to which the asset belongs. This may be the case because measuring the recoverable amount requires forecasting cash flows and sometimes individual assets do not generate cash flows by themselves. An asset’s operating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset and that are operated largely independently from other assets or groups of assets.

- E5.11 In assessing whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, an NPO shall consider, as a minimum, the following indications:

External sources of information

- (a) during the period, an asset’s market value has declined significantly more than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use.

- (b) significant changes with an adverse effect on the NPO have taken place during the period, or will take place in the near future, in the technological, market, economic, service delivery or legal environment in which the NPO operates or in the activities to which an asset is dedicated.

- (c) market interest rates or other market rates of return on investments have increased during the period, and those increases are likely to affect materially the discount rate used in calculating an asset’s value in use and decrease the asset’s fair value less costs to sell.

- (d) the carrying amount of the net assets of the NPO is more than the estimated fair value of the NPO as a whole (such an estimate may have been made, for example, in relation to the potential sale of part or all of the NPO).

Internal sources of information

- (e) evidence is available of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset.

- (f) significant changes with an adverse effect on the NPO have taken place during the period or are expected to take place in the near future in the extent to which, or manner in which, an asset is used or is expected to be used. These changes include the asset becoming idle, plans to discontinue or restructure the operation to which an asset belongs and plans to dispose of an asset before the previously expected date.

- (g) evidence is available from internal reporting that indicates that the economic performance of an asset is, or will be, worse than expected. In this context, economic performance includes operating results and cash flows.

- E5.12 If there is an indication that an asset may be impaired, this may indicate that the NPO should review the remaining useful life, the depreciation (amortisation) method or the residual value for the asset and adjust it in accordance with the section of this Standard applicable to the asset (for example, E2 and E4 Intangible assets other than goodwill), even if no impairment loss is recognised for the asset.

Measuring recoverable amount

- The recoverable amount of an asset or an operating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, references in paragraphs E5.14–E5.22 to an asset should be read as references also to an asset’s operating unit.

- E5.14 It is not always necessary to determine both an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If either of these amounts exceeds the asset’s carrying amount, the asset is not impaired, and it is not necessary to estimate the other amount.

- E5.15 If there is no reason to believe that an asset’s value in use materially exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, the asset’s fair value less costs to sell may be used as its recoverable amount. This will often be the case for an asset that is held for disposal.

Fair value less costs to sell

- E5.16 When measuring fair value less costs to sell, an entity shall apply the guidance on measuring fair value in A4 Fair value measurement and deduct the costs of disposal.

Value in use

- E5.17 Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows, other economic benefits or service potential expected to be derived from an asset. This present value calculation involves the following steps:

- (a) estimating the future cash inflows and outflows to be derived from continuing use of the asset and from its ultimate disposal;

- (b) estimating the economic benefit or service potential the NPO expects to derive from the asset; and

- (c) applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows.

- The following elements shall be reflected in the calculation of an asset’s value in use:

- (a) an estimate of the future cash flows, other economic benefits or service potential the NPO expects to derive from the asset;

- (b) expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future benefits;

- the time value of money, represented by the current market risk-free rate of interest;

- the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset; and

- (e) other factors, such as illiquidity, that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the NPO expects to derive from the asset.

- E5.19 In measuring value in use, estimates of future cash flows shall include:

- (a) projections of cash inflows from the continuing use of the asset;

- (b) projections of cash outflows that are necessarily incurred to generate the cash inflows from continuing use of the asset (including cash outflows to prepare the asset for use) and can be directly attributed or allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis to the asset; and

- (c) net cash flows, if any, expected to be received (or paid) for the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life in an arm’s-length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties.

The NPO may wish to use any recent financial budgets or forecasts to estimate the cash flows, if available. To estimate cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the most recent budgets or forecasts, an NPO may wish to extrapolate the projections based on the budgets or forecasts using a steady or declining growth rate for subsequent years, unless an increasing rate can be justified.

- E5.20 Estimates of future cash flows shall not include:

- (a) cash inflows or outflows from financing activities; or

- (b) income tax receipts or payments.

- E5.21 Future cash flows shall be estimated for the asset in its current condition. Estimates of future cash flows shall not include estimated future cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from:

- (a) a future restructuring to which an NPO is not yet committed; or

- (b) improving or enhancing the asset’s performance.

- E5.22 The discount rate (rates) used in the present value calculation shall be a pre-tax rate (rates) that reflect(s) current market assessments of:

- (a) the time value of money; and

- (b) the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.

The discount rate (rates) used to measure an asset’s value in use shall not reflect risks for which the future cash flow estimates have been adjusted to avoid double-counting.

Recognising and measuring an impairment loss for an operating unit

- E5.23 An impairment loss shall be recognised for an operating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit. The impairment loss shall be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order:

- (a) first, to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the operating unit; and

- (b) then, to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the operating unit.

- E5.24 However, an NPO shall not reduce the carrying amount of any asset in the operating unit below the highest of:

- (a) its fair value less costs to sell (if determinable);

- (b) its value in use (if determinable); and

- (c) zero.

- E5.25 Any excess amount of the impairment loss that cannot be allocated to an asset because of the restriction in paragraph E5.24 shall be allocated to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of those other assets.

Additional requirements for impairment of goodwill

- Goodwill by itself cannot be sold. Nor does it generate cash flows to an entity that are independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a consequence, the fair value of goodwill cannot be measured directly. Consequently, the fair value of goodwill must be derived from measurement of the fair value of the operating unit(s) of which the goodwill is a part.

- E5.27 For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the acquiring NPO’s operating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

- Part of the recoverable amount of an operating unit is attributable to the non-controlling interest in goodwill. For the purpose of impairment testing a non-wholly owned operating unit with goodwill, the carrying amount of that unit is notionally adjusted, before being compared with its recoverable amount, by grossing up the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the unit to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest. This notionally adjusted carrying amount is then compared with the recoverable amount of the unit to determine whether the operating unit is impaired.

- E5.29 If goodwill cannot be allocated to individual operating units (or groups of operating units) on a non-arbitrary basis, then for the purposes of testing goodwill, the NPO shall test the impairment of goodwill by determining the recoverable amount of either:

- (a) the acquired entity in its entirety if the goodwill relates to an acquired entity that has not been integrated (integrated means the acquired operation has been restructured or dissolved into the reporting NPO or other controlled entities); or

- (b) the entire group of entities, excluding any entities that have not been integrated, if the goodwill relates to an entity that has been integrated.

In applying this paragraph, an NPO will need to separate goodwill into goodwill relating to entities that have been integrated and goodwill relating to entities that have not been integrated. Also, the NPO shall follow the requirements for operating units in this Section when calculating the recoverable amount of, and allocating impairment losses and reversals to assets belonging to, the acquired entity or group of entities.

Reversal of an impairment loss

- E5.30 An impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.

- E5.31 For all assets other than goodwill, an NPO shall assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Indications that an impairment loss may have decreased or may no longer exist are generally the opposite of those set out in paragraph E5.11. If any such indication exists, the NPO shall determine whether all or part of the prior impairment loss should be reversed. The procedure for making that determination will depend on whether the prior impairment loss on the asset was based on:

- (a) the recoverable amount of that individual asset (see paragraph E5.32); or

- (b) the recoverable amount of the operating unit to which the asset belongs (see paragraph E5.33).

Reversal where recoverable amount was estimated for an individual

- E5.32 When the prior impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of the individual impaired asset, the following requirements apply:

- (a) the NPO shall estimate the recoverable amount of the asset at the current reporting date.

- (b) if the estimated recoverable amount of the asset exceeds its carrying amount, the NPO shall increase the carrying amount to recoverable amount, subject to the limitation described in (c). That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The NPO shall recognise the reversal immediately in surplus or deficit, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with the revaluation model in paragraph E2.18. Any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation increase in accordance with paragraph E2.19.

- (c) the reversal of an impairment loss shall not increase the carrying amount of the asset above the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.

- (d) after a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, the NPO shall adjust the depreciation (amortisation) charge for the asset in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

Reversal when recoverable amount was estimated for an operating unit

- When the original impairment loss was based on the recoverable amount of the operating unit to which the asset belongs, the following requirements apply:

- (a) the NPO shall estimate the recoverable amount of that operating unit at the current reporting date.

- (b) if the estimated recoverable amount of the operating unit exceeds its carrying amount, that excess is a reversal of an impairment loss. The NPO shall allocate the amount of that reversal to the assets of the unit, except for goodwill, pro rata with the carrying amounts of those assets, subject to the limitation described in (c). Those increases in carrying amounts shall be treated as reversals of impairment losses for individual assets and be recognised immediately in surplus or deficit, unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount in accordance with the revaluation model in paragraph E2.18. Any reversal of an impairment loss of a revalued asset shall be treated as a revaluation increase in accordance with paragraph E2.19.

- (c) in allocating a reversal of an impairment loss for an operating unit, the reversal shall not increase the carrying amount of any asset above the lower of:

- (i) its recoverable amount; and

- (ii) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.

- (d) any excess amount of the reversal of the impairment loss that cannot be allocated to an asset because of the restriction in (c) shall be allocated pro rata to the other assets of the operating unit, except for goodwill.

- (e) after a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised, if applicable, the NPO shall adjust the depreciation (amortisation) charge for each asset in the operating unit in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less its residual value (if any), on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.

Disclosures

- E5.34 An NPO shall disclose the following for each class of assets indicated in paragraph E5.35:

- (a) the amount of impairment losses recognised in surplus or deficit during the period and the line item(s) in the Statement of Income and Expenses in which those impairment losses are included; and

- (b) the amount of reversals of impairment losses recognised in surplus or deficit during the period and the line item(s) in the Statement of Income and Expenses in which those impairment losses are reversed.

- E5.35 An NPO shall disclose the information required by paragraph E5.34 for each of the following classes of asset:

- (a) inventories;

- (b) property, plant and equipment (including investment property accounted for by the cost method);

- (c) goodwill;

- (d) intangible assets other than goodwill;

- (e) investments in associates; and

- (f) investments in jointly controlled entities.

E6 – Specialised activities

Scope of this Section

- E6.1 This Section provides guidance on financial reporting by an NPO involved in three types of specialised activities – agriculture, extractive activities and service concessions.

Agriculture

- E6.2 An NPO applying this Standard that is engaged in agricultural activity shall determine its accounting policy for each class of its biological assets, except for bearer plants that can be measured separately from the produce on them without undue cost or effort (see paragraph E6.3) as follows:

- (a) the NPO shall use the fair value model in paragraphs E6.6–E6.9 for those biological assets for which fair value is readily determinable without undue cost or effort; and

- (b) the NPO shall use the cost model in paragraphs E6.10–E6.12 for all other biological assets.

- This Section does not apply to bearer plants that at initial recognition can be measured, both initially and on an ongoing basis, separately from the produce on them without undue cost or effort (see E2 Property, plant and equipment). However, this Section applies to the produce on those bearer plants. If at initial recognition an NPO determines that bearer plants cannot be measured separately from the produce on them without undue cost or effort initially or on an ongoing basis, this Section applies to the entire plant.

- E6.4 Examples of plants that are not bearer plants:

- (a) plants cultivated to be harvested as agricultural produce (for example, trees grown for use as lumber or trees that are cultivated both for their fruit and their lumber); and

- (b) annual crops (for example, maize and wheat).

Recognition

- E6.5 An NPO shall recognise a biological asset or agricultural produce when, and only when:

- (a) the NPO controls the asset as a result of past events;

- (b) it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the NPO; and

- the fair value or cost of the asset can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.

Measurement – fair value model

- E6.6 An NPO shall measure a biological asset on initial recognition and at each reporting date at its fair value less costs to sell. Changes in fair value less costs to sell shall be recognised in

surplus or deficit.

- E6.7 Agricultural produce harvested from an NPO’s biological assets shall be measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest. Such measurement is the cost at that date when applying E1 Inventories or another applicable section of this Standard.

- E6.8 A4 Fair value measurement provides guidance on fair value measurement.

Disclosures – fair value model

- E6.9 An NPO shall disclose the following with respect to its biological assets measured at fair value:

- (a) a description of each class of its biological assets.

- (b) a reconciliation of changes in the carrying amount of biological assets between the beginning and the end of the current period. The reconciliation shall include:

- (i) the gain or loss arising from changes in fair value less costs to sell;

- (ii) increases resulting from purchases;

- (iii) decreases resulting from harvest;

- (iv) increases resulting from business combinations;

- (v) net exchange differences arising on the translation of financial statements into a different presentation currency and on the translation of a foreign operation into the presentation currency of the reporting entity; and

- (vi) other changes.

This reconciliation need not be presented for prior periods.

Measurement – cost model

- E6.10 The NPO shall measure at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses those biological assets whose fair value is not readily determinable without undue cost or effort.

- E6.11 The NPO shall measure agricultural produce harvested from its biological assets at fair value less estimated costs to sell at the point of harvest. Such measurement is the cost at that date when applying E1 or other sections of this Standard.

Disclosures – cost model

- E6.12 An NPO shall disclose the following with respect to its biological assets measured using the cost model:

- (a) a description of each class of its biological assets;

- (b) an explanation of why fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort;

- (c) the depreciation method used;

- (d) the useful lives or the depreciation rates used; and

- (e) the gross carrying amount and the accumulated depreciation (aggregated with accumulated impairment losses) at the beginning and end of the period.

Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources

- An NPO using this Standard that is engaged in the exploration for, or evaluation of, mineral resources shall determine an accounting policy that specifies which expenditures are recognised as exploration and evaluation assets in accordance with paragraph B7.4 and apply the policy consistently. An entity is exempt from applying paragraph B7.5 to its accounting policies for the recognition and measurement of exploration and evaluation assets.

- E6.14 The following are examples of expenditures that might be included in the initial measurement of exploration and evaluation assets (the list is not exhaustive):

- (a) acquisition of rights to explore;

- (b) topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies;

- (c) exploratory drilling;

- (d) trenching;

- (e) sampling; and

- (f) activities in relation to evaluating the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting a mineral resource.

Expenditures related to the development of mineral resources shall not be recognised as exploration and evaluation assets.

- E6.15 Exploration and evaluation assets shall be measured on initial recognition at cost. After initial recognition, an NPO shall apply E2 and E4 Intangible assets other than goodwill to the exploration and evaluation assets according to the nature of the assets acquired subject to paragraphs E6.17–E6.19. If an NPO has an obligation to dismantle or remove an item, or to restore the site, such obligations and costs are accounted for in accordance with E2 and D5 Provisions and contingencies.

- E6.16 Exploration and evaluation assets shall be assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an exploration and evaluation asset may exceed its recoverable amount. An NPO shall measure, present and disclose any resulting impairment loss in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets, except as provided by paragraph E6.19.

- E6.17 For the purposes of exploration and evaluation assets only, paragraph E6.18 shall be applied instead of paragraphs E5.9–E5.12 when identifying an exploration and evaluation asset that may be impaired. Paragraph E6.18 uses the term ‘assets’ but applies equally to separate exploration and evaluation assets or an operating unit.

- E6.18 One or more of the following facts and circumstances indicate that an NPO should test exploration and evaluation assets for impairment (the list is not exhaustive):

- (a) the period for which the NPO has the right to explore in the specific area has expired during the period, or will expire in the near future and is not expected to be renewed;

- (b) substantive expenditure on further exploration for, and evaluation of, mineral resources in the specific area is neither budgeted nor planned;

- (c) exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the specific area have not led to the discovery of commercially viable quantities of mineral resources and the NPO has decided to discontinue such activities in the specific area; or

- (d) sufficient data exists to indicate that although a development in the specific area is likely to proceed, the carrying amount of the exploration and evaluation asset is unlikely to be recovered in full from successful development or by sale.

The NPO shall perform an impairment test and recognise any impairment loss in accordance with E5.

- An NPO shall determine an accounting policy for allocating exploration and evaluation assets to operating units or groups of operating units for the purpose of assessing such assets for impairment.

- E6.20 An NPO shall treat exploration and evaluation assets as a separate class of assets and make the disclosures required by either E2 or E4 consistent with how the assets are classified.

Service concession arrangements

- E6.21 A service concession arrangement is an arrangement whereby a government or other public sector body (the grantor) contracts with a private operator to develop (or upgrade), operate

and maintain the grantor’s infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, energy distribution networks, prisons or hospitals. In those arrangements, the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide using the assets, to whom, and at what price and also controls any significant residual interest in the assets at the end of the term of the arrangement.

- E6.22 There are two principal categories of service concession arrangements:

- (a) in one, the operator receives a financial asset – an unconditional contractual right to receive a specified or determinable amount of cash or another financial asset from the government in return for constructing or upgrading a public sector asset and then operating and maintaining the asset for a specified period of time. This category includes guarantees by the government to pay for any shortfall between amounts received from users of the public service and specified or determinable amounts.

- (b) in the other, the operator receives an intangible asset – a right to charge for use of a public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades and then operates and maintains for a specified period of time. A right to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service.

Sometimes a single contract may contain both types: to the extent that the government has given an unconditional guarantee of payment for the construction of the public sector asset, the operator has a financial asset; to the extent that the operator has to rely on the public using the service in order to obtain payment, the operator has an intangible asset.

Accounting – financial asset model

- The operator shall recognise a financial asset to the extent that it has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor for the construction services. The operator shall measure the financial asset at fair value. Thereafter, it shall follow F1 Financial instruments in accounting for the financial asset.

Accounting – intangible asset model

- The operator shall recognise an intangible asset to the extent that it receives a right (a licence) to charge users of the public service. The operator shall initially measure the intangible asset at fair value. Thereafter, it shall follow E4 in accounting for the intangible asset.

Operating revenue

- E6.25 The operator of a service concession arrangement shall recognise, measure and disclose revenue in accordance with C1 Revenue for the services it performs.

F1 – Financial instruments

Scope of this Section

- F1 Financial instruments deals with recognising, derecognising, measuring and disclosing financial instruments (financial assets and financial liabilities). Part I of F1 applies to basic financial instruments and is relevant to all NPOs. Part II of F1 applies to other, more complex financial instruments and transactions. If an entity enters into only basic financial instrument transactions, then Part II of F1 is not applicable. However, all NPOs shall consider the scope of Part II of F1 to ensure they are exempt.

Part I of F1 – Basic financial instruments

Introduction to Part I of F1

- F1.2 A financial instrument is a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument or equity claim on another entity.

- Part I of F1 requires an amortised cost model for all basic financial instruments, except for investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary or preference shares that are publicly traded or whose fair value can otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.

- F1.4 Basic financial instruments within the scope of Part I of F1 are those that satisfy the conditions in paragraph F1.8. Examples of financial instruments that normally satisfy those conditions include:

- (a) cash;

- (b) demand and fixed-term deposits when the NPO is the depositor – for example, bank accounts;

- (c) commercial paper and commercial bills held;

- (d) accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable;

- (e) bonds and similar debt instruments;

- (f) investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary and preference shares; and

- (g) commitments to receive a loan if the commitment cannot be net settled in cash.

- F1.5 Examples of financial instruments that do not normally satisfy the conditions in paragraph F1.8 and are therefore within the scope of Part II of F1, include:

- (a) asset-backed securities such as collateralised mortgage obligations, repurchase agreements and securitised packages of receivables;

- (b) options, rights, warrants, futures contracts, forward contracts and interest rate swaps that can be settled in cash or by exchanging another financial instrument;

- (c) financial instruments that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments in accordance with the requirements in Part II of F1;

- (d) commitments to make a loan to another entity;

- (e) commitments to receive a loan if the commitment can be net settled in cash;

- (f) contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination; and

- (g) issued financial guarantee contracts – however, financial guarantee contracts issued at nil consideration when the specified debtor is another NPO within the group are in the scope of D5 Provisions and contingencies (see paragraph D5.2).

Scope of Part I of F1

- F1.6 Part I of F1 applies to all financial instruments meeting the conditions of paragraph F1.8 except for the following:

- (a) interests in controlled entities and associates and joint arrangements that are accounted for in accordance with G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements, G2 Investments in associates or G3 Joint arrangements;

- (b) financial instruments that meet the definition of an NPO’s own equity claims, including the equity component of compound financial instruments issued by the NPO (see F2 Liabilities and equity claims);

- (c) leases to which D6 Leases or paragraph F1.52(f) apply. However, the derecognition requirements in paragraphs F1.34–F1.39 apply to the derecognition of lease receivables recognised by a lessor and lease payables recognised by a lessee, and the impairment requirements in paragraphs F1.28–F1.33 apply to lease receivables recognised by a lessor;

- (d) employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to which D4 Employee benefits applies;

- (e) reimbursement assets that are accounted for in accordance with D5 (see paragraph D5.12); and

- (f) rights and obligations within the scope of C1 Revenue that are financial instruments, except for receivables that meet the conditions in paragraph F1.8(b).

- F1.7 The impairment requirements in paragraphs F1.28–F1.33 apply to contract assets.

Basic financial instruments

- F1.8 An NPO shall account for the following financial instruments as basic financial instruments in accordance with Part I of F1:

- (a) cash;

- (b) a debt instrument (such as an account, note or loan receivable or payable) that meets the conditions in paragraph F1.9 and/or paragraph F1.10;

- (c) a commitment to receive a loan that:

- (i) cannot be settled net in cash; and

- (ii) when the commitment is executed is expected to meet the conditions in paragraph F1.9; and

- (d) an investment in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary shares or preference shares.

- F1.9 A debt instrument that satisfies all of the conditions in (a)–(d) shall be accounted for in accordance with Part I of F1:

- returns to the holder (the lender/creditor) assessed in the currency in which the debt instrument is denominated are either:

- (i) a fixed amount;

- (ii) a fixed rate of return over the life of the instrument;

- (iii) a variable return that, throughout the life of the instrument, is equal to a single referenced quoted or observable interest rate (such as Sterling Overnight Indexed Average (SONIA)); or

- (iv) some combination of such fixed and variable rates, provided that both the fixed and variable rates are positive (for example, an interest rate swap with a positive fixed rate and negative variable rate would not meet this criterion).

For fixed and variable rate interest returns, interest is calculated by multiplying the rate for the applicable period by the principal amount outstanding during the period.

- (b) there is no contractual provision that could, by its terms, result in the holder (the lender/ creditor) losing the principal amount or any interest attributable to the current period or prior periods. The fact that a debt instrument is subordinated to other debt instruments is not an example of such a contractual provision. A party may pay or receive reasonable compensation on early termination of a contract and still meet this condition.

- (c) contractual provisions that permit or require the issuer (the borrower) to prepay a debt instrument or permit or require the holder (the lender/creditor) to put it back to the issuer (ie to demand repayment) before maturity are not contingent on future events other than to protect:

- (i) the holder against a change in the credit risk of the issuer or the instrument (for example, defaults, credit downgrades or loan covenant violations) or a change in control of the issuer; or

- the holder or issuer against changes in relevant taxation or law.

- there are no conditional returns or repayment provisions except for the variable rate return described in (a) and prepayment provisions described in (c).

- A debt instrument that does not meet all of the conditions in paragraph F1.9(a)–(d) shall nevertheless be accounted for in accordance with Part I of F1 if the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount. A debt instrument with contractual terms that introduce exposure to unrelated risks or volatility – for example, changes in equity prices or commodity prices – is unlikely to meet this requirement. For the purpose of the requirement in this paragraph, ‘interest’ includes reasonable compensation for the time value of money, credit risk and other basic lending risks and costs – for example, liquidity risk, administrative costs associated with holding the instrument and lender’s profit margin – consistent with a basic lending arrangement.

- F1.11 Examples of debt instruments that would normally satisfy the conditions in paragraph F1.9(a)(iv) include:

- (a) a bank loan that has a fixed interest rate for an initial period that then reverts to a quoted or observable variable interest rate after that period; and

- (b) a bank loan with interest payable at a quoted or observable variable interest rate plus a fixed rate throughout the life of the loan – for example, SONIA plus 200 basis points.

- F1.12 An example of a debt instrument that would normally satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph F1.9(b)–(c) would be a bank loan that permits the borrower to terminate the arrangement early, even though the borrower may be required to pay a penalty to compensate the bank for its costs of the borrower terminating the arrangement early.

- F1.13 Other examples of financial instruments that would normally satisfy the conditions in paragraph F1.9 are:

- (a) trade accounts and notes receivable and payable, and loans from banks or other third parties.

- (b) accounts payable in a foreign currency. However, any change in the account payable because of a change in the exchange rate is recognised in surplus or deficit as required by paragraph A5.12.

- (c) loans to or from controlled entities or associates that are due on demand.

- (d) a debt instrument that would become immediately receivable if the issuer defaults on an interest or principal payment (such a provision does not violate the conditions in paragraph F1.9).

- F1.14 Examples of financial instruments that do not satisfy the conditions in paragraph F1.9 or F1.10 (and are therefore within the scope of Part II of F1) include:

- (a) an investment in another entity’s equity instruments other than non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary and preference shares (see paragraph F1.8(d);

- (b) an interest rate swap that returns a cash flow that is positive or negative, or a forward commitment to purchase a commodity or financial instrument that is capable of being cash settled and that, on settlement, could have positive or negative cash flow because such swaps and forwards do not meet the condition in paragraph F1.9(a);

- (c) options and forward contracts because returns to the holder are not fixed and the condition in paragraph F1.9(a) is not met; and

- (d) investments in convertible debt because the return to the holder can vary with the price of the issuer’s equity shares instead of just with market interest rates.

- F1.15 An NPO shall not reassess the classification of a financial instrument after initial recognition.

Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities

- F1.16 An NPO shall recognise a financial asset or a financial liability only when the NPO becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Initial measurement

- F1.17 When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an NPO shall measure it at the transaction price (including transaction costs except in the initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities that are subsequently measured at fair value through surplus or deficit) unless:

- (a) the financial asset is a trade receivable (see paragraph F1.18); or

- (b) the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction for either the entity (for a financial liability) or the counterparty (for a financial asset) to the arrangement (see paragraph F1.19).

- F1.18 A trade receivable shall be recognised initially at the amount determined by applying C1, unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction and the entity does not apply the option in paragraph C1.149. For such arrangements, the NPO shall measure the trade receivable in accordance with paragraph F1.19.

- An arrangement constitutes a financing transaction if payment is deferred beyond normal business terms – for example, providing interest-free credit to a buyer for the sale of goods – or is financed at a rate of interest that is not a market rate – for example, an interest-free or below market interest rate loan made to an employee. If the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, the NPO shall measure the financial asset or financial liability at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument as determined at initial recognition.

Subsequent measurement

- F1.20 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall measure financial instruments as follows, without any deduction for transaction costs the NPO may incur on sale or other disposal:

- (a) debt instruments that meet the conditions in paragraph F1.8(b) shall be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Paragraphs F1.22–F1.27 provide guidance on determining amortised cost using the effective interest method. Debt instruments that are classified as current assets or current liabilities shall be measured at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received (that is, net of impairment – see paragraphs F1.28–F1.33) unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction (see paragraphs F1.17 and F1.19). Operating receivables that are classified as current assets shall be measured at the undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be received (that is, net of impairment) unless the arrangement constitutes, in effect, a financing transaction and the NPO does not apply the option in paragraph C1.149.

- (b) commitments to receive a loan that meet the conditions in paragraph F1.8(c) shall be measured at cost (which sometimes is nil) less impairment.

- investments in non-convertible preference shares and non-puttable ordinary or preference shares shall be measured as follows (A4 Fair value measurement provides guidance on fair value):

- (i) if the shares are publicly traded or their fair value can otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the investment shall be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit; and

- (ii) all other such investments shall be measured at cost less impairment.

Impairment or uncollectability must be assessed for financial assets in (a), (b) and (c)(ii). Paragraphs F1.28–F1.33 provide guidance.

- F1.21 Dividends are recognised in surplus or deficit only when:

- (a) the NPO’s right to receive payment is established;

- (b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the NPO; and

- (c) the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.

Amortised cost and effective interest method

F1.22 The amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability at each reporting date is the net of the following amounts:

- (a) the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition;

- (b) minus any repayments of the principal;

- (c) plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the amount at initial recognition and the maturity amount;

- (d) minus, in the case of a financial asset, any reduction (directly or through the use of an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability.

Financial assets and financial liabilities that have no stated interest rate, that do not relate to an arrangement that constitutes a financing transaction and that are classified as current assets or current liabilities are initially measured at an undiscounted amount in accordance with paragraph F1.17. Consequently, (c) does not apply to them.

- The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or a group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or when appropriate a shorter period, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The effective interest rate is determined on the basis of the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability at initial recognition. Under the effective interest method:

- (a) the amortised cost of a financial asset (liability) is the present value of future cash receipts (payments) discounted at the effective interest rate; and

- (b) the interest expense (income) in a period equals the carrying amount of the financial liability (asset) at the beginning of a period multiplied by the effective interest rate for the period.

- When calculating the effective interest rate, an NPO shall estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, call and similar options) and known credit losses that have been incurred, but it shall not consider possible future credit losses not yet incurred.

- F1.25 When calculating the effective interest rate, an NPO shall amortise any related fees, finance charges paid or received (such as ‘points’), transaction costs and other premiums or discounts over the expected life of the instrument, except as follows. The NPO shall use a shorter period if that is the period to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate. This will be the case when the variable to which the fees, finance charges paid or received, transaction costs, premiums or discounts relate is repriced to market rates before the expected maturity of the instrument. In such a case, the appropriate amortisation period is the period to the next such repricing date.

- F1.26 For variable rate financial assets and variable rate financial liabilities, periodic re-estimation of cash flows to reflect changes in market rates of interest alters the effective interest rate. If a variable rate financial asset or variable rate financial liability is recognised initially at an amount equal to the principal receivable or payable at maturity, re-estimating the future interest payments normally has no significant effect on the carrying amount of the asset or liability.

- F1.27 If an NPO revises its estimates of payments or receipts, the NPO shall adjust the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability (or group of financial instruments) to reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows. The NPO shall recalculate the carrying amount by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate. The NPO shall recognise the adjustment as income or expense in surplus or deficit at the date of the revision.

Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets and financial assets measured at cost

Recognition

- F1.28 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment of any financial assets that are measured at cost or amortised cost. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the NPO shall recognise an impairment loss in surplus or deficit immediately.

- F1.29 Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that come to the attention of the holder of the asset about the following loss events:

- (a) significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor;

- (b) a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments;

- (c) the creditor, for economic or legal reasons relating to the debtor’s financial difficulty, granting to the debtor a concession that the creditor would not otherwise consider;

- (d) it has become probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

- (e) observable data indicating that there has been a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets since the initial recognition of those assets, even though the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group, such as adverse national or local economic conditions or adverse changes in industry conditions.

- Other factors may also be evidence of impairment, including significant changes with an adverse effect that have taken place in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the debtor or issuer operates.

- F1.31 An NPO shall assess the following financial assets individually for impairment:

- (a) all equity instruments regardless of significance; and

- (b) other financial assets that are individually significant.

An NPO shall assess other financial assets for impairment either individually or grouped on the basis of similar credit risk characteristics.

Measurement

- F1.32 An NPO shall measure an impairment loss on the following financial assets measured at cost or amortised cost as follows:

- (a) for a financial asset measured at amortised cost in accordance with paragraph F1.20(a), the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. If such a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

- (b) for a financial asset measured at cost less impairment in accordance with paragraphs F1.20(b) and F1.20(c)(ii), the impairment loss is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the best estimate (which will necessarily be an approximation) of the amount (which might be zero) that the entity would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.

Reversal

- If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the NPO shall reverse the previously recognised impairment loss, either directly or by adjusting an allowance account. The reversal shall not result in a carrying amount of the financial asset (net of any allowance account) that exceeds what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not previously been recognised. The NPO shall recognise the amount of the reversal in surplus or deficit immediately.

Derecognition of a financial asset

- F1.34 An NPO shall derecognise a financial asset only when either:

- (a) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are settled;

- (b) the NPO transfers to another party substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset; or

- the NPO, despite having retained some significant risks and rewards of ownership, has transferred control of the asset to another party and the other party has the practical ability to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party and is able to exercise that ability unilaterally and without needing to impose additional restrictions on the transfer – in this case, the entity shall:

- (i) derecognise the asset; and

- (ii) recognise separately any rights and obligations retained or created in the transfer.

The carrying amount of the transferred asset shall be allocated between the rights or obligations retained and those transferred on the basis of their relative fair values at the transfer date. Newly created rights and obligations shall be measured at their fair values at that date. Any difference between the consideration received and the amounts recognised and derecognised in accordance with this paragraph shall be recognised in surplus or deficit in the period of the transfer.

- If a transfer does not result in derecognition because the NPO has retained significant risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, the NPO shall continue to recognise the transferred asset in its entirety and shall recognise a financial liability for the consideration received. The asset and liability shall not be offset. In subsequent periods, the NPO shall recognise any income on the transferred asset and any expense incurred on the financial liability.

- If a transferor provides non-cash collateral (such as debt or equity instruments) to the transferee, the accounting for the collateral by the transferor and the transferee depends on whether the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the collateral and on whether the transferor has defaulted. The transferor and transferee shall account for the collateral as follows:

- (a) if the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral, the transferor shall reclassify that asset in its Statement of Financial Position (for example, as a loaned asset, pledged equity instruments or repurchase receivable) separately from other assets;

- (b) if the transferee sells collateral pledged to it, it shall recognise the proceeds from the sale and a liability measured at fair value for its obligation to return the collateral;

- (c) if the transferor defaults under the terms of the contract and is no longer entitled to redeem the collateral, it shall derecognise the collateral and the transferee shall recognise the collateral as its asset initially measured at fair value or, if it has already sold the collateral, derecognise its obligation to return the collateral; and

- (d) except as provided in (c), the transferor shall continue to carry the collateral as its asset and the transferee shall not recognise the collateral as an asset.

Derecognition of a financial liability

- F1.37 An NPO shall derecognise a financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) only when it is extinguished – that is when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.

- F1.38 If an existing borrower and lender exchange financial instruments with substantially different terms, the entities shall account for the transaction as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, an NPO shall account for a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability or a part of it (whether or not attributable to the financial difficulty of the debtor) as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.

- F1.39 The NPO shall recognise in surplus or deficit any difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability (or part of a financial liability) extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed.

Disclosures

- F1.40 The following disclosures make reference to disclosures for financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit. Entities that have only basic financial instruments (and therefore do not apply Part II of F1) will not have any financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit and hence will not need to provide such disclosures.

Disclosure of accounting policies for financial instruments

- In accordance with paragraph B6.5, an NPO shall disclose material accounting policy information. Information about the measurement basis (or bases) for financial instruments used in preparing the financial statements is expected to be material accounting policy information.

Statement of Financial Position – categories of financial assets and financial liabilities

- F1.42 An NPO shall disclose the carrying amounts of each of the following categories of financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date, in total, either in the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes:

- (a) financial assets measured at fair value through surplus or deficit (paragraph F1.20(c)(i) and paragraph F1.57);

- (b) financial assets that are debt instruments measured at amortised cost (paragraph F1.20(a));

- (c) financial assets that are equity instruments measured at cost less impairment (paragraph F1.20(c)(ii) and paragraph F1.57);

- (d) financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit (paragraph F1.57);

- (e) financial liabilities measured at amortised cost (paragraph F1.20(a)); and

- (f) loan commitments measured at cost less impairment (paragraph F1.20(b)).

- F1.43 An NPO shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for its financial position and activities in the reporting period. For example, for long-term debt, such information would normally include the terms and conditions of the debt instrument (such as interest rate, maturity, repayment schedule, and restrictions that the debt instrument imposes on the NPO).

- F1.44 An NPO shall disclose an analysis of the age, by reference to due date, of operating receivables and other financial assets measured at amortised cost as at the reporting date, showing separately:

- (a) the amortised cost of the financial assets before adjusting for any reduction (directly or by using an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability (see paragraph F1.22(d)); and

- (b) any reduction (directly or by using an allowance account) for impairment or uncollectability (see paragraph F1.22(d)).

- F1.45 An NPO shall disclose a maturity analysis for financial liabilities by category (see paragraphs F1.42(d)–F1.42(e)). The maturity analysis shall include the remaining contractual maturities. The contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analysis are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

- F1.46 In preparing the disclosures in paragraphs F1.44–F1.45, an NPO shall use time bands it considers to be the most useful. For example, for paragraph F1.44 the time bands might be:

- (a) not later than one month;

- later than one month and not later than three months;

- (c) later than three months and not later than one year;

- later than one year and not later than five years; and

- (e) later than five years.

- If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available, or is not available without undue cost or effort when such an exemption is provided, for any financial instruments that would otherwise be required to be measured at fair value through surplus or deficit in accordance with this Standard, the NPO shall disclose that fact, the carrying amount of those financial instruments and, if an undue cost or effort exemption has been used, the reasons why a reliable fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort.

Transferred financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition

- F1.48 If an NPO has transferred financial assets to another party in a transaction that does not qualify for derecognition (see paragraphs F1.34–F1.36), the NPO shall disclose the following for each class of such financial assets:

- (a) the nature of the assets;

- (b) the nature of the risks and rewards of ownership to which the NPO remains exposed; and

- (c) the carrying amounts of the assets and of any associated liabilities that the NPO continues to recognise.

Collateral

- When an NPO has pledged financial assets as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities, it shall disclose the following:

- (a) the carrying amount of the financial assets pledged as collateral; and

- (b) the terms and conditions relating to its pledge.

Defaults and breaches on loans payable

- F1.50 For loans payable recognised at the reporting date for which there is a breach of terms or a default of principal, interest, sinking fund or redemption terms that have not been remedied by the reporting date, an NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) details of that breach or default;

- (b) the carrying amount of the related loans payable at the reporting date; and

- (c) whether the breach or default was remedied, or the terms of the loans payable were renegotiated, before the financial statements were authorised for issue.

Items of income, expense, gains or losses

- F1.51 An NPO shall disclose the following items of income, expense, gains or losses:

- income, expense, gains or losses, including changes in fair value, recognised on:

- (i) financial assets measured at fair value through surplus or deficit;

- (ii) financial liabilities measured at fair value through surplus or deficit;

- (iii) financial assets measured at amortised cost; and

- (iv) financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

- (b) total interest income and total interest expense (calculated using the effective interest method) for financial assets or financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through surplus or deficit; and

- (c) the amount of any impairment loss for each class of financial asset.

Scope of Part II of F1

- F1.52 Part II of F1 applies to all financial instruments except the following:

- (a) those covered by Part I of F1.

- (b) investments in controlled entities and associates and joint arrangements that are accounted for in accordance with G1, G2 or G3.

- (c) employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans (see D4);

- (d) rights under insurance contracts unless the insurance contract could result in a loss to either party as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to:

- (i) changes in the insured risk;

- (ii) changes in foreign exchange rates; or

- (iii) a default by one of the counterparties;

- (e) financial instruments that meet the definition of an NPO’s own equity claims, including the equity component of compound financial instruments issued by the NPO (see F2).

- (f) leases within the scope of D6. Consequently, Part II of F1 applies to leases that could result in a loss to the lessor or the lessee as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to:

- (i) changes in the price of the leased asset;

- (ii) changes in foreign exchange rates;

- (iii) changes in lease payments based on variable market interest rates; or

- (iv) a default by one of the counterparties.

- the measurement requirements do not apply to contracts for contingent consideration in a business combination (see G4 Business combinations and goodwill) whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date (see paragraph G4.29).

- (h) reimbursement assets that are accounted for in accordance with D5 (see paragraph D5.12).

- (i) rights and obligations within the scope of C1 that are financial instruments, except for trade receivables that are not accounted for in accordance with Part I of F1.

- (j) financial guarantee contracts issued at nil consideration when the specified debtor is another entity within the group (see paragraph D5.2). Part II of F1 applies to other issued financial guarantee contracts.

- F1.53 Most contracts to buy or sell a non-financial item such as a commodity, inventory or property, plant and equipment are excluded from this Section because they are not financial instruments. However, Part II of F1 applies to all contracts that impose risks on the buyer or seller that are not typical of contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. For example, Part II of F1 applies to contracts that could result in a loss to the buyer or seller as a result of contractual terms that are unrelated to changes in the price of the non-financial item, changes in foreign exchange rates or a default by one of the counterparties.

- In addition to the contracts described in paragraph F1.53, Part II of F1 applies to contracts to buy or sell non-financial items if the contract can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument, or by exchanging financial instruments as if the contracts were financial instruments, with the following exception: contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the NPO’s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are not financial instruments for the purposes of F1.

Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities

- F1.55 An NPO shall recognise a financial asset or a financial liability only when the NPO becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Initial measurement

- F1.56 When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an NPO shall measure it at its fair value, which is normally the transaction price.

Subsequent measurement

- F1.57 At the end of each reporting period, an NPO shall measure all financial instruments within the scope of Part II of F1 at fair value and recognise changes in fair value in surplus or deficit, except as follows:

- (a) some changes in the fair value of hedging instruments in a designated hedging relationship are required to be recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets by paragraph F1.72; and

- (b) equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured reliably without undue cost or effort and contracts linked to such instruments that, if exercised, will result in delivery of such instruments shall be measured at cost less impairment.

- F1.58 Dividends are recognised in surplus or deficit only when:

- (a) the NPO’s right to receive payment is established;

- (b) it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the NPO; and

- (c) the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.

- F1.59 If a reliable measure of fair value is no longer available without undue cost or effort for an equity instrument, or a contract linked to such an instrument that if exercised will result in the delivery of such instruments, that is not publicly traded but is measured at fair value through surplus or deficit, its fair value at the last date that the instrument was reliably measurable

without undue cost or effort is treated as the cost of the instrument. The NPO shall measure the instrument at this cost amount less impairment until it is able to determine a reliable measure of fair value without undue cost or effort.

Fair value

- F1.60 An NPO shall apply the guidance on fair value in A4 to fair value measurements in accordance with F1.

- F1.61 The fair value of a financial liability that is due on demand is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.

Impairment of financial assets measured at cost or amortised cost

- F1.62 An NPO shall apply the guidance on impairment in paragraphs F1.28–F1.33 to financial assets measured at cost less impairment in accordance with Part II of F1.

Derecognition of a financial asset or financial liability

- F1.63 An NPO shall apply the derecognition requirements in paragraphs F1.34–F1.39 to financial assets and financial liabilities to which F1 applies.

Hedge accounting

- If specified criteria are met, an NPO may designate a hedging relationship between a hedging instrument and a hedged item in such a way as to qualify for hedge accounting. Hedge accounting permits the gain or loss on the hedging instrument and on the hedged item to be recognised in surplus or deficit at the same time.

- F1.65 To qualify for hedge accounting, an NPO shall comply with all of the following conditions:

- (a) the NPO designates and documents the hedging relationship so that the risk being hedged, the hedged item and the hedging instrument are clearly identified and the risk in the hedged item is the risk being hedged with the hedging instrument;

- (b) the hedged risk is one of the risks specified in paragraph F1.66;

- the hedging instrument is as specified in paragraph F1.67; and

- (d) the NPO expects the hedging instrument to be highly effective in offsetting the designated hedged risk. The effectiveness of a hedge is the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument.

- F1.66 This Standard permits hedge accounting only for the following risks:

- (a) interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost;

- (b) foreign exchange or interest rate risk in a firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction;

- (c) price risk of a commodity that an NPO holds or in a firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction to purchase or sell a commodity; and

- (d) foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation.

Foreign exchange risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost is not in the list because hedge accounting would not have any significant effect on the financial statements. Basic accounts, notes and loans receivable and payable are normally measured at amortised cost (see paragraph F1.4(d)). This would include payables denominated in a foreign currency. Paragraph A5.12 requires any change in the carrying amount of the payable because of a

change in the exchange rate to be recognised in surplus or deficit. Consequently, both the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (the cross-currency swap) and the change in the carrying amount of the payable relating to the change in the exchange rate would be recognised in surplus or deficit and should offset each other except to the extent of the difference between the spot rate (at which the liability is measured) and the forward rate (at which the swap is measured).

- F1.67 This Standard permits hedge accounting only if the hedging instrument has all of following terms and conditions:

- it is an interest rate swap, a foreign currency swap, a foreign currency forward exchange contract or a commodity forward exchange contract that is expected to be highly effective in offsetting a risk identified in paragraph F1.66 that is designated as the hedged risk;

- (b) it involves a party external to the reporting NPO (that is, external to the group or individual NPO being reported on);

- (c) its notional amount is equal to the designated amount of the principal or notional amount of the hedged item;

- (d) it has a specified maturity date not later than:

- (i) the maturity of the financial instrument being hedged;

- (ii) the expected settlement of the commodity purchase or sale commitment; or

- (iii) the occurrence of the highly probable forecast foreign currency or commodity transaction being hedged.

- (e) it has no prepayment, early termination or extension features.

Hedge of fixed interest rate risk of a recognised financial instrument or commodity price risk of a commodity held

- F1.68 If the conditions in paragraph F1.65 are met and the hedged risk is the exposure to a fixed interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost or the commodity price risk of a commodity that it holds, the NPO shall:

- (a) recognise the hedging instrument as an asset or liability and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in surplus or deficit; and

- (b) recognise the change in the fair value of the hedged item related to the hedged risk in surplus or deficit and as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item.

- F1.69 If the hedged risk is the fixed interest rate risk of a debt instrument measured at amortised cost, the NPO shall recognise the periodic net cash settlements on the interest rate swap that is the hedging instrument in surplus or deficit in the period in which the net settlements accrue.

- F1.70 The NPO shall discontinue the hedge accounting specified in paragraph F1.68 if:

- (a) the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;

- (b) the hedge no longer meets the conditions for hedge accounting specified in paragraph F1.65; or

- (c) the NPO revokes the designation.

- F1.71 If hedge accounting is discontinued and the hedged item is an asset or liability carried at amortised cost that has not been derecognised, any gains or losses recognised as adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortised into surplus or deficit using the effective interest method over the remaining life of the hedged item.

Hedge of variable interest rate risk of a recognised financial instrument, foreign exchange risk or commodity price risk in a firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation

- F1.72 If the conditions in paragraph F1.65 are met and the hedged risk is:

- (a) the variable interest rate risk in a debt instrument measured at amortised cost;

- the foreign exchange risk in a firm commitment or a highly probable forecast transaction;

- the commodity price risk in a firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction; or

- the foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation,

the NPO shall recognise in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets the portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument that was effective in offsetting the change in the fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item. The NPO shall recognise in surplus or deficit in each period any excess (in absolute amount) of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument over the cumulative change in the fair value of the expected cash flows of the hedged item since inception of the hedge (sometimes called hedge ineffectiveness). The hedging gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets shall be reclassified to surplus or deficit when the hedged item is recognised in surplus or deficit, subject to the requirements in paragraph F1.74. However, the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets shall not be reclassified to surplus or deficit on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.

- F1.73 If the hedged risk is the variable interest rate risk in a debt instrument measured at amortised cost, the NPO shall subsequently recognise in surplus or deficit the periodic net cash settlements from the interest rate swap that is the hedging instrument in the period in which the net settlements accrue.

- F1.74 The NPO shall discontinue prospectively the hedge accounting specified in paragraph F1.72 if:

- (a) the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;

- (b) the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting in paragraph F1.65;

- in a hedge of a forecast transaction, the forecast transaction is no longer highly probable; or

- (d) the NPO revokes the designation.

If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to take place or if the hedged debt instrument measured at amortised cost is derecognised, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument that was recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets shall be reclassified to surplus or deficit.

Disclosures

- F1.75 An NPO applying Part II of F1 shall make all of the disclosures required in Part I of F1, incorporating in those disclosures financial instruments that are within the scope of Part II of F1 as well as those within the scope of Part I of F1. In addition, if the NPO uses hedge accounting, it shall make the additional disclosures in paragraphs F1.76–F1.78.

- F1.76 An NPO shall disclose the following separately for hedges of each of the four types of risks described in paragraph F1.66:

- (a) a description of the hedge;

- (b) a description of the financial instruments designated as hedging instruments and their fair values at the reporting date; and

- (c) the nature of the risks being hedged, including a description of the hedged item.

- F1.77 If an NPO uses hedge accounting for a hedge of fixed interest rate risk or commodity price risk of a commodity held (paragraphs F1.68–F1.71), it shall disclose the following:

- (a) the amount of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in surplus or deficit for the period; and

- (b) the amount of the change in fair value of the hedged item recognised in surplus or deficit for the period.

- F1.78 If an NPO uses hedge accounting for a hedge of variable interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk in a firm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation (paragraphs F1.72–F1.74), it shall disclose the following:

- (a) the periods when the cash flows are expected to occur and when they are expected to affect surplus or deficit;

- (b) a description of any forecast transaction for which hedge accounting had previously been used but which is no longer expected to occur;

- (c) the amount of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument that was recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets during the period (paragraph F1.72);

- (d) the amount that was reclassified to surplus or deficit for the period (paragraphs F1.72 and F1.74); and

- (e) the amount of any excess of the cumulative change in fair value of the hedging instrument over the cumulative change in the fair value of the expected cash flows that was recognised in surplus or deficit for the period (paragraph F1.72).

Application Guidance F1 – Financial

Scope (share-based payments)

- An NPO is not expected to have equity claims that are traded for their commercial value. As a consequence, share-based payments are not expected to be relevant. In the rare circumstance that an NPO has a financial instrument, contract or obligation that is a share-based payment, the NPO shall follow the requirements of Section 26 Shared-based payment of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- AF1.2 Should the guidance in AF1.1 not address a specific transaction, in line with P28, guidance should be sought initially from full IFRS Accounting Standards before considering IPSAS and then guidance issued by national standard setters.

Basic financial instruments

- F1 refers to debt instruments. Debt instruments are used to raise funds and contain a contract that specifies the terms for repaying the amount provided. They include credit cards, loans, bonds and debt securities. Debt instruments for many NPOs will comprise loans made to or by an NPO.

- AF1.4 F1.8 includes cash as a basic financial instrument. As per the examples in F1.4, for the purposes of this Section, cash also includes cash equivalents.

F2 – Liabilities and equity claims

Scope of this Section

- This Section establishes principles for classifying financial instruments as either liabilities or equity claims and addresses accounting for equity instruments issued to individuals or other parties acting in their capacity as investors in equity instruments (that is, in their capacity as holders of equity claims).

- F2.2 This Section shall be applied when classifying all types of financial instruments except:

- (a) those interests in controlled entities, associates and joint arrangements that are accounted for in accordance with G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements, G2 Investments in associates or G3 Joint arrangements.

- (b) employers’ rights and obligations under employee benefit plans, to which D4 Employee benefits applies.

Classification of a financial instrument as a liability or

- F2.3 For the purpose of this Section, a liability is a present obligation of the NPO arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the NPO of resources embodying economic benefits. Equity claims are the financial interest in the net assets of an NPO. Equity claims include investments by the holders of equity claims, plus or minus changes to those investments earned through their share of retained surpluses, minus reductions as a result of deficits and distributions.

- An NPO shall classify a financial instrument as a financial liability or an equity claim in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement, not merely its legal form, and in accordance with the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. Unless an NPO has an unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset to settle a contractual obligation, the obligation meets the definition of a financial liability and is classified as such, except for those instruments classified as equity instruments in accordance with paragraph F2.5.

- F2.5 Some financial instruments that meet the definition of a liability are classified as equity claims because they represent a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO:

- (a) a puttable instrument is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right to sell that instrument back to the issuer for cash or another financial asset or is automatically redeemed or repurchased by the issuer on the occurrence of an uncertain future event or the death or retirement of the instrument holder. A puttable instrument that has all of the following features is classified as an equity instrument:

- (i) it entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the NPO’s net assets in the event of the NPO’s liquidation or ceasing to be an NPO as set out in the equity claims agreement.

- (ii) the instrument is in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments.

- (iii) all financial instruments in the class of instruments that is subordinate to all other classes of instruments have identical features.

- (iv) apart from the contractual obligation for the issuer to repurchase or redeem the instrument for cash or another financial asset, the instrument does not include any

contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the NPO, and it is not a contract that will or may be settled in the NPO’s own equity instruments.

- (b) instruments, or components of instruments, that are subordinate to all other classes of instruments are classified as equity claims if they impose on the NPO an obligation to deliver to another party a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO only on liquidation or ceasing to be an NPO.

- The following are examples of instruments that are classified as liabilities instead of equity claims:

- (a) an instrument is classified as a liability if the distribution of net assets on liquidation or on ceasing to be an NPO is subject to a maximum amount (a ceiling). For example, if the holders of the instrument receive a pro rata share of the net assets but this amount is limited to a ceiling and the excess net assets are distributed to another NPO or the government, the instrument is not classified as an equity claim.

- (b) an instrument is classified as a liability if the instrument can only be redeemed at par or at an amount index-linked to the amount originally paid. In other words, the holder of the equity instrument does not have a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO.

- (c) a puttable instrument is classified as an equity claim if, when the put option is exercised, the holder receives a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO as set out in the equity claim arrangement measured in accordance with this Standard. However, if the holder is entitled to an amount measured on some other basis (such as local GAAP), the instrument is classified as a liability.

- (d) an instrument is classified as a liability if it obliges the NPO to make payments to the holder before liquidation or on ceasing to be an NPO, such as a mandatory distribution.

- (e) a puttable instrument that is classified as equity or an equity claim in a controlled entity’s financial statements is classified as a liability in the controlling NPO’s consolidated financial statements.

- (f) a preference share that provides for mandatory redemption by the issuer for a fixed or determinable amount at a fixed or determinable future date or gives the holder the right to require the issuer to redeem the instrument at or after a particular date for a fixed or determinable amount is a financial liability.

- Members’ shares in a co-operative and similar instruments are equity claims if:

- (a) the NPO has an unconditional right to refuse redemption of the members’ shares; or

- (b) redemption is unconditionally prohibited by local law, regulation or the NPO’s governing charter.

Original issue of shares or other equity instruments

- An NPO shall recognise the issue of shares or other equity instruments as equity claims when it issues those instruments and another party is obliged to provide cash or other resources to the NPO in exchange for the instruments:

- (a) if the equity instruments are issued before the NPO receives the cash or other resources, the NPO shall present the amount receivable as an offset to equity claims in its Statement of Financial Position unless local laws or regulations prohibit such presentation (in which case the entity shall comply with the presentation requirements in the local laws or regulations);

- (b) if the NPO receives the cash or other resources before the equity instruments are issued, and the NPO cannot be required to repay the cash or other resources received, the NPO shall recognise the corresponding increase in equity claims to the extent of consideration received; and

- (c) to the extent that the equity instruments have been subscribed for but not issued, and the NPO has not yet received the cash or other resources, the NPO shall not recognise an increase in equity claims.

- An NPO shall measure equity instruments, other than those issued as part of a business combination or those accounted for in accordance with paragraphs F2.13–F2.15, at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of transaction costs. If payment is deferred and the time value of money is material, the initial measurement shall be on a present value basis.

- F2.10 An NPO shall account for the transaction costs of an equity claim transaction as a deduction from equity claims. Income tax relating to the transaction costs shall be accounted for in accordance with D8 Income tax.

- F2.11 How the increase in equity claims arising on the issue of shares or other equity instruments is presented in the Statement of Financial Position is determined by applicable laws. For example, the par value (or other nominal value) of shares and the amount paid in excess of par value may be required to be presented separately.

Capitalisation or bonus issues of shares and share splits

- F2.12 A capitalisation or bonus issue (sometimes referred to as a stock dividend) is the issue of new shares to equity claim holders in proportion to their existing holdings. For example, an NPO may give its equity claim holders one dividend or bonus share for every five shares held. A share split (sometimes referred to as a stock split) is the dividing of an NPO’s existing shares into multiple shares. For example, in a share split, each equity claim holder may receive one additional share for each share held. In some cases, the previously outstanding shares are cancelled and replaced by new shares. Capitalisation and bonus issues and share splits do not change total equity claims. An NPO shall reclassify amounts within equity claims as required by applicable laws.

Convertible debt or similar compound financial instruments

- F2.13 On issuing convertible debt or similar compound financial instruments that contain both a liability and an equity claims component, an NPO shall allocate the proceeds between the liability component and the equity claims component. To make the allocation, the NPO shall first determine the amount of the liability component as the fair value of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature or similar associated equity component. The NPO shall allocate the residual amount as the equity component. Transaction costs shall be allocated between the debt component and the equity component on the basis of their relative fair values.

- F2.14 The NPO shall not revise the allocation in a subsequent period.

- F2.15 In periods after the instruments were issued, the NPO shall account for the liability component as follows:

- (a) in accordance with Part I of F1 Basic financial instruments if the liability component meets the conditions in paragraph F1.9 or paragraph F1.10. In these cases, the NPO shall systematically recognise any difference between the liability component and the

principal amount payable at maturity as additional interest expense using the effective interest method (see paragraphs F1.22–F1.27).

- (b) in accordance with Part II of F1 Other financial instruments issues if the liability component does not meet the conditions in paragraph F1.9 or paragraph F1.10.

Distributions to holders of equity claims

- F2.16 An NPO shall reduce equity claims for the amount of distributions to its holders of equity claims (holders of its equity instruments). Income tax relating to distributions to holders of equity claims shall be accounted for in accordance with D8.

- Sometimes an NPO distributes assets other than cash to its holders of equity claims (‘non-cash distributions’). When an NPO declares such a distribution and has an obligation to distribute non-cash assets to its holders of equity claims, it shall recognise a liability. It shall measure the liability at the fair value of the assets to be distributed unless it meets the conditions in paragraph F2.18. At the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, the NPO shall review and adjust the carrying amount of the capital distribution payable to reflect changes in the fair value of the assets to be distributed, with any changes recognised in equity claims as adjustments to the amount of the distribution. When an NPO settles the capital distribution payable, it shall recognise in surplus or deficit any difference between the carrying amount of the assets distributed and the carrying amount of the capital distribution payable.

- F2.18 If the fair value of the assets to be distributed cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the liability shall be measured at the carrying amount of the assets to be distributed. If prior to settlement the fair value of the assets to be distributed can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the liability is remeasured at fair value, with a corresponding adjustment made to the amount of the distribution and accounted for in accordance with paragraph F2.17.

- Paragraphs F2.17–F2.18 do not apply to the distribution of a non-cash asset that is ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the distribution. This exclusion applies to the separate, individual and consolidated financial statements of an NPO that makes the distribution.

Disclosures

- F2.20 If the fair value of the assets to be distributed as described in paragraphs F2.17–F2.18 cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort, the NPO shall disclose that fact and the reasons why a reliable fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort.

G1 – Consolidated and separate financial

Scope of this Section

- This Section defines the circumstances in which an NPO applying this Standard presents consolidated financial statements and the procedures for preparing those statements in accordance with this Standard. It also includes guidance on separate financial statements and combined financial statements if they are prepared in accordance with this Standard. A controlling NPO by itself may present its separate financial statements in accordance with this Standard, even if it presents its consolidated financial statements in accordance with full IFRS Accounting Standards or another set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Requirement to present consolidated financial statements

- Except as permitted or required by paragraphs G1.3 and G1.6, a controlling NPO shall present consolidated financial statements. Consolidated financial statements shall include all controlled entities of the controlling NPO, except subsidiaries, to which paragraph G1.4 applies.

- G1.3 A controlling NPO need not present consolidated financial statements if both the following conditions are met:

- (a) the controlling NPO is itself a controlled entity; and

- (b) its ultimate controlling entity (or any intermediate controlling entity) produces consolidated general purpose financial reports that comply with an international or national financial reporting framework or with this Standard.

- Subject to paragraph G1.5, a controlled entity is not consolidated if it is acquired and is held with the intention of selling or disposing of it within one year from its acquisition date (see paragraph G4.12). Such a controlled entity is accounted for in accordance with the requirements in F1 Financial instruments for investments in paragraph F1.8(d), instead of in accordance with this Section. The controlling NPO shall also provide the disclosure in paragraph G1.42.

- G1.5 If a controlled entity previously excluded from consolidation in accordance with paragraph G1.4 is not disposed of within one year from its acquisition date:

- (a) the controlling NPO shall consolidate the controlled entity from the acquisition date unless it meets the condition in (b). Consequently, if the acquisition date was in a prior period, the relevant prior periods shall be restated.

- (b) if the delay is caused by events or circumstances beyond the controlling NPO’s control and there is sufficient evidence at the reporting date that the controlling NPO remains committed to its plan to sell or dispose of the controlled entity, the controlling NPO shall continue to account for the controlled entity in accordance with paragraph G1.4.

- If a controlling NPO has no controlled entities other than controlled entities that are not consolidated in accordance with paragraphs G1.4–G1.5, it shall not present consolidated financial statements. However, the controlling NPO shall provide the disclosure in paragraph G1.42.

- G1.7 A controlled entity is not excluded from consolidation because:

- (a) its operating activities are dissimilar to those of the other entities within the consolidation. Relevant information is provided by consolidating such controlled entities and disclosing additional information in the consolidated financial statements about the different operating activities of controlled entities.

- (b) it operates in a jurisdiction that imposes restrictions on transferring cash or other assets out of the jurisdiction.

Control

- G1.8 A controlled entity is an entity that is controlled by an NPO (the controlling NPO). An NPO, regardless of the nature of its involvement with the other entity, shall determine whether it is a controlling NPO by assessing whether it controls the other entity.

- G1.9 An NPO controls an entity when the NPO is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

- G1.10 Thus, an NPO controls an entity if the NPO has all the following:

- (a) power over the entity;

- (b) exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and

- (c) the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of its returns.

- G1.11 An NPO shall consider all the facts and circumstances when assessing whether it controls an entity. The NPO shall reassess whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed in paragraph G1.10.

- Control is presumed to exist when the NPO holds, directly or indirectly through controlled entities, a majority of the voting rights of an entity. An NPO that holds, directly or indirectly through controlled entities, a majority of the voting rights of an entity is not required to assess whether it has the elements of control listed in paragraph G1.10.

- G1.13 Control will exist if voting rights are held – not as a result of ownership, but because of a governance arrangement established to deliver an NPO’s objectives or purposes. Control is also presumed to exist when the NPO holds half or less of the voting power of an entity but has:

- (a) power over more than half of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with other investors;

- (b) power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute, as a consequence of a contract or other agreement;

- (c) power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body where control of the entity is exercised by that board or body; or

- (d) power to cast the majority of votes at meetings of the board of directors or equivalent governing body and control of the entity is by that board or body.

- However, the presumptions in paragraphs G1.12 and G1.13 can be rebutted if it can be clearly demonstrated that the NPO does not have one or more of the elements of control listed in paragraph G1.10 – for example, if the NPO holds or has power over a majority of the voting rights of an entity, but another entity has existing rights that give that other entity the current ability to direct the relevant activities through contractual arrangements.

- G1.15 An NPO has power over an entity when the NPO has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities – that is, the activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns. Rights that allow the NPO to:

- (a) direct the policies of the governing body of another entity;

- (b) significantly amend or veto service or capital budgets relating to the relevant activities of another entity; or

- (c) direct the transactions of another entity that relate to the relevant activities of that entity

may individually or in combination, or together with other factors, give the controlling NPO the ability to direct the relevant activities of another entity.

- G1.16 Depending on the circumstances, relevant activities can include:

- (a) selling and purchasing of goods and services;

- (b) selecting, acquiring or disposing of assets;

- (c) providing services in line with the NPO’s objectives; and

- (d) fundraising.

- G1.17 An NPO with the current ability to direct the relevant activities has power even if its rights to direct have yet to be exercised. Evidence that the NPO has been directing relevant activities can help determine whether the NPO has power but is not in itself conclusive in determining whether the NPO has power over an entity.

- G1.18 If two or more controlling entities (which may or may not both be NPOs) each have existing rights that give them the unilateral ability to direct different relevant activities, the entity that has the current ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the returns of the controlled entity has power over the controlled entity.

- G1.19 When determining whether it has power, an NPO considers its potential voting rights as well as potential voting rights held by other parties. Potential voting rights are rights to obtain voting rights of an entity, such as those arising from convertible instruments or options, including forward contracts. Those potential voting rights are considered only if the holder of the right has the practical ability to exercise that right. Usually, for the holder of the right to have the practical ability to exercise that right, the right needs to be currently exercisable.

- G1.20 If an NPO also has voting or other decision-making rights relating to another entity’s relevant activities (such as those identified in paragraphs G1.15 and G1.16), the NPO assesses whether those rights, in combination with potential voting rights, give the NPO power.

Returns

- G1.21 An NPO is exposed or has rights to variable returns or variable benefits to the public and service beneficiaries from its involvement with the other entity when the NPO’s returns from its involvement have the potential to vary as a result of the other entity’s performance. The NPO’s returns can be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative.

- G1.22 For an NPO to control an entity, the NPO must not only have power over the entity and exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity, but also the ability to use its power to affect its returns from its involvement with the other entity.

- G1.23 When an NPO with decision-making rights (a decision maker) assesses whether it controls an entity, it shall determine whether it is a principal or an agent. An NPO shall also determine whether another entity with decision-making rights is acting as an agent for the NPO. An agent is a party primarily engaged to act on behalf and for the benefit of another party or parties (the principal(s)) and therefore does not control the entity being assessed when it exercises its decision-making authority. Thus, sometimes a principal’s power may be held and exercisable by an agent, but on behalf of the principal. A decision maker is not an agent simply because other parties can benefit from the decisions that it makes.

Determining whether consolidation of all entities is appropriate

- G1.24 A controlling NPO shall consider the fundamental characteristics of faithful representation and relevance. If exceptionally excluding an entity from consolidation would provide the most relevant information available about a controlling NPO and its controlled entities, then an NPO should not consolidate that entity.

- G1.25 Where an NPO does not consolidate a controlled entity, it shall disclose:

- (a) why consolidation would impact faithful representation or relevance;

- (b) the relationship between the entities, including how the entities work together for the purposes of the controlling NPO’s mission and the economic relationship between the entities;

- (c) the governance arrangements in place between the entities; and

- (d) related party information as required by H1 Related party disclosures.

Consolidation procedures

- G1.26 The consolidated financial statements present financial information about the group as a single reporting entity or other complete set of activities related to an NPO’s purposes. In preparing consolidated financial statements, an NPO shall:

- (a) combine the financial statements of the controlling NPO and its controlled entities line by line by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity claims, income and

expenses.

- (b) eliminate the carrying amount of the controlling NPO’s investment or beneficial interest in each controlled entity and the controlling NPO’s portion of funds or equity of each controlled entity.

- G1.27 If any controlled entity has a non-controlling interest, an NPO shall:

- (a) measure and present non-controlling interest in the surplus or deficit of consolidated controlled entities for the reporting period separately from holders of equity claims of the controlling NPO.

- (b) measure and present non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated controlled entities separately from the controlling NPO’s interest in them. Non-controlling interest in the net assets consists of:

- (i) the amount of the non-controlling interest at the date of the original combination calculated in accordance with G4 Business combinations and goodwill; and

- (ii) the non-controlling interest’s share of changes in net assets since the date of the combination.

- G1.28 If a controlling NPO needs to allocate amounts between non-controlling interests and other interests, the proportions of surplus or deficit and changes in equity claims and funds with and without restriction of the controlling NPO and to the non-controlling interest are determined

on the basis of existing controlling interests and do not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights, and other options or convertible instruments.

Intragroup balances and transactions

- G1.29 Intragroup balances and transactions, including income, expenses and dividends, are eliminated in full. Surpluses or deficits resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are eliminated in full. Intragroup deficits may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements (see E5 Impairment of assets). D8 Income tax applies to temporary differences that arise from the elimination of surpluses or deficits resulting from

intragroup transactions.

Uniform reporting date

- The financial statements of the controlling NPO and its controlled entities used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements shall be prepared as of the same reporting date unless it is impracticable to do so. If it is impracticable to prepare the financial statements of a controlled entity as of the same reporting date as the controlling NPO, the controlling NPO shall consolidate the financial information of the controlled entity using the most recent financial statements of the controlled entity, adjusted for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur between the date of those financial statements and the date of the consolidated financial statements.

Uniform accounting policies

- G1.31 Consolidated financial statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events and conditions in similar circumstances. If a controlled entity uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to its financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Acquisition and disposal of controlled entities

- G1.32 The income and expenses of a controlled entity are included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date until the date on which the controlling NPO loses control of the controlled entity.

- G1.33 If a controlling NPO loses control of a controlled entity, the controlling NPO:

- (a) derecognises:

- (i) the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities at their carrying amounts at the date control is lost in the former controlled entity; and

- (ii) the carrying amount of any non-controlling interests in the former controlled entity at the date when control is lost (including any components recognised in surplus or deficit or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets attributable to them);

- (b) recognises:

- (i) the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the transaction or event that resulted in the loss of control; and

- (ii) any interest retained in the former controlled entity at its fair value on the date control is lost; and

- (c) recognises the gain or loss associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest in surplus or deficit.

- G1.34 If a controlling NPO loses control of a controlled entity, the controlling NPO shall account for all amounts previously recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets for that controlled entity, except for the cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to a foreign controlled entity, on the same basis as would be required if the controlling NPO had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. The cumulative amount of any exchange differences that relate to a foreign controlled entity recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets in accordance with A5 Foreign currency translation is not reclassified to surplus or deficit on disposal of the controlled entity.

- G1.35 If a controlling NPO loses control of a controlled entity but continues to hold an investment or beneficial interest in the former controlled entity, that investment or beneficial interest shall be accounted for in accordance with other sections of this Standard. If the retained interest is a financial asset, F1 applies; if it is an associate, G2 Investments in associates applies; if is a jointly controlled entity, G3 Joint arrangements applies. The fair value at the date when control is lost shall be regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset or cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity, if applicable.

Non-controlling interests in controlled entities

- G1.36 It is expected to be uncommon for an NPO to have non-controlling interests. Where an NPO has controlling interests, it shall apply paragraphs G1.37–G1.38.

- An NPO shall present non-controlling interest in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position within net assets, separately from the interests of the holders of equity claims of the controlling NPO, as required by paragraph B2.2(r).

- G1.38 An NPO shall treat changes in a controlling NPO’s controlling interest in a controlled entity that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Accordingly, the carrying amount of the non-controlling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in the controlling NPO’s interest in the controlled entity’s net assets. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is so adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received, if any, shall be recognised directly in net assets and attributed to the controlling NPO. An NPO shall not recognise any gain or loss on these changes. Also, an NPO shall not recognise any change in the carrying amounts of assets (including goodwill) or liabilities as a result of such transactions.

- G1.39 An NPO shall disclose non-controlling interest in the surplus or deficit of the group separately in the Statement of Income and Expenses, as required by paragraph B3.8.

- G1.40 Surplus or deficit shall be attributed to the interests of the holders of equity claims and to the non-controlling interest, even if this results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance.

Disclosures in consolidated financial statements

- G1.41 The following disclosures shall be made in consolidated financial statements:

- the fact that the financial statements are consolidated financial statements;

- (b) the basis for concluding that control exists when the controlling NPO does not hold, directly or indirectly through controlled entities, a majority of the voting rights over the other entity;

- (c) any difference in the reporting date of the financial statements of the controlling NPO and its controlled entities used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements; and

- (d) the nature and extent of any significant restrictions (for example, resulting from borrowing arrangements or regulatory requirements) on the ability of controlled entities to transfer funds to the controlling NPO in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans.

- G1.42 If applicable, in addition to the disclosure requirements in F1 a controlling NPO shall disclose the carrying amount of its investment or beneficial interest in controlled entities that are not consolidated (see paragraphs G1.3–G1.5) at the reporting date, in total, either in the Statement of Financial Position or in the notes.

- G1.43 If applicable, an NPO shall disclose the gain or loss, if any, calculated in accordance with paragraphs G1.32–G1.34, and:

- (a) the portion of that gain or loss attributable to measuring any investment retained in the former controlled entity at its fair value at the date when control is lost, and

- (b) the line items in surplus or deficit in which the gain or loss is recognised (if not presented separately).

Separate financial statements

Presentation of separate financial statements

- G1.44 This Standard does not require presentation of separate financial statements for the controlling NPO or for the individual controlled entities.

- G1.45 Separate financial statements are presented by an NPO in addition to any of the following:

- (a) consolidated financial statements prepared by a controlling NPO;

- (b) financial statements prepared by a controlling NPO exempted from preparing consolidated financial statements by paragraph G1.6; or

- (c) financial statements prepared by an NPO that is an investor in an associate or has joint control in a jointly controlled entity.

- G1.46 A controlling NPO that is exempt in accordance with paragraph G1.3 from preparing consolidated financial statements is permitted to present separate financial statements as its only financial statements.

- G1.47 When an NPO prepares separate financial statements and describes them as conforming to INPAS, those statements shall comply with all of the requirements of this Standard, except as follows. The NPO shall adopt a policy of accounting for its investment or beneficial interests in controlled entities, associates and jointly controlled entities in its separate financial statements either:

- (a) at cost less impairment;

- (b) at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit; or

- (c) using the equity method following the procedures in paragraph G2.8.

The NPO shall apply the same accounting policy for all investments in a single class (controlled entities, associates or jointly controlled entities), but it can elect different policies for different classes.

Disclosures in separate financial statements

- G1.48 When an NPO prepares separate financial statements, those separate financial statements shall disclose:

- (a) that the statements are separate financial statements;

- (b) a description of the methods used to account for the investment or beneficial interest in the controlled entities, jointly controlled entities and associates; and

- (c) either

- (i) the consolidated financial statements or other financial statements to which they relate; or

- (ii) the name and principal place of business (and country of incorporation, if different) of the entity whose consolidated financial statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards, another set of national GAAP, or with INPAS if the NPO has chosen not to prepare consolidated financial statements, in accordance with paragraph G1.3.

Combined financial statements

- G1.49 Combined financial statements are the financial statements of a reporting entity that comprises two or more entities that are not all linked by a controlling NPO – controlled entity relationship. This Standard does not require combined financial statements to be prepared.

- If the controlling NPO prepares combined financial statements and describes them as conforming to INPAS, those statements shall comply with all of the requirements of this Standard. Inter-entity transactions and balances shall be eliminated; surpluses or deficits or profits or losses resulting from inter-entity transactions that are recognised in assets such as inventory and property, plant and equipment shall be eliminated; the financial statements of the entities included in the combined financial statements shall be prepared as of the same reporting date, unless it is impracticable to do so; and uniform accounting policies shall be followed for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

Disclosures in combined financial statements

- G1.51 The combined financial statements shall disclose the following:

- (a) the fact that the financial statements are combined financial statements;

- (b) the reason why combined financial statements are prepared;

- (c) the basis for determining which entities are included in the combined financial statements;

- (d) the basis of preparation of the combined financial statements; and

- (e) the related party disclosures required by H1.

Application Guidance G1 – Consolidated and separate financial statements

Control

- AG1.1 An NPO controls other entities for a variety of reasons. An NPO may control other entities (including NPOs and non-NPOs) specifically to provide services to the public. It may also create trading entities or may invest in non-NPOs with the intention of generating a surplus,

which will be used to support activities for the benefit of the public. Unlike for-profit entities, the purpose of acquiring control over another entity or establishing another entity as part of an economic group of undertakings is not to generate a financial return for distribution to providers of risk capital.

- AG1.2 Paragraphs G1.8-G1.23 set out the basis of control. This basis of control, which includes power, returns and the linkage between power and returns, have aspects and nuances for an NPO. Control, power and return need to be interpreted in the context of benefit to the public and activities that further the purposes of the controlling NPO for the benefit of the public. These wider considerations are explained below, and specific guidance is provided on each.

Power

- AG1.3 Paragraph G1.15 says that a parent NPO (controlling NPO) has power over an entity when the controlling NPO has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities of the entity or direct the use of the funds of the entity.

- AG1.4 Where the other entity is an incorporated for-profit entity, power is likely to mainly be achieved through voting rights, as the entity will have issued share capital or capital instruments that give rise to voting rights. Power is presumed to exist where the controlling NPO owns, directly or through other controlled entities, the majority of the voting rights relating to the entity. Power will also be presumed to exist when the controlling NPO does not own the majority of voting rights but can exercise voting rights held by others, or can exercise other decision- making rights, which may include:

- (a) the ability to exercise the majority of voting rights (through voting rights owned by the entity and contractual arrangements with other vote holders); or

- (b) the right to appoint the majority of board members; or

- (c) the right to appoint the majority of the key management personnel; or

- (d) a right to reject any or all of the activities that the entity might choose to undertake; or

- (e) a right to reject any or all of the uses to which the funds of the entity may be put.

- AG1.5 Where the other entity is a non-profit entity (including an entity in the public sector), power is less likely to depend on voting rights. The ability to direct the activities of the entity or the use of the entity’s funds are more likely to give rise to power than voting rights. Therefore, power is presumed to exist where the controlling NPO has:

- (a) the right to appoint the majority of the governing body of the entity directly; or

- (b) the right to appoint the majority of the key management personnel; or

- (c) a right to reject any or all of the activities that the entity might choose to undertake; or

- (d) a right to reject any or all of the uses to which the funds of the entity may be put; or

- (e) the ability to exercise the majority of any voting rights where these exist separately from the governing body; or

- (f) the right to achieve any of the above through a combination of the controlling NPO’s own rights and the rights of other entities that the controlling NPO controls.

- AG1.6 Some rights to direct the use of funds may not give rise to the level of power required to exercise control. For example, where an NPO makes grants to other entities, grant agreements may set out conditions that a grant recipient only uses the funds provided to undertake the activities for which the grant was made and for no other purpose. The agreement only relates to one aspect of the recipient entity’s purposes and activities. It does not generally provide a right to the grantor to direct all the activities of the grant-receiving entity. In this situation, the expectation is the recipient is not in substance an entity controlled by the grantor.

- AG1.7 For an NPO delivering activities for the benefit of the public, including making social investments in entities to deliver benefits to the public, the notion of financial returns is sometimes relevant, but in other cases is simply not appropriate. Instead of financial returns, the focus in considering return is on benefits that the controlling NPO receives. This approach allows for non-financial as well as financial benefits.

- AG1.8 A controlling NPO is exposed or has rights to variable benefits from its involvement with a controlled entity when, as a result of its interest, the controlling NPO is exposed to both the positive and negative effects of the controlled entity’s activities and performance. These effects relate to the impact on and ability of the controlling NPO to further its purposes.

- A return from an interest in another entity is therefore not necessarily a matter of obtaining funds or a financial return from the entity. Rather the return can be a non-financial benefit that the controlling NPO derives from the activities of the entity. These non-financial benefits exist where they lead to the direct or partial fulfilment of one or more of the purposes of the controlling NPO. For example, NPO A provides access to safe drinking water and has a relationship with NPO B that provides research into waterborne diseases. The type of research carried out by NPO B could have a direct bearing on the purposes of NPO A. For a control relationship to exist then, in addition to having power over NPO B, NPO A would need to be directly impacted by the activities of NPO B on a day-to-day basis (have continuous exposure) rather than, for example, being the beneficiary of a specific one-off piece of research.

- AG1.10 A controlling NPO may have an interest in a for-profit entity to further a social purpose for the benefit of the public. A controlling NPO’s interest in this situation is not held primarily for a financial return, but for benefit in furthering its objectives.

Linking power and returns

- AG1.11 As set out in paragraph G1.22, in order for a controlling NPO to have control over an entity, it must have power, it must be exposed to variable returns, and it must be able to use its power over the other entity to influence the amount of the controlling NPO’s returns. Power and returns must therefore be linked. Entities that provide a return to a controlling NPO, but where the controlling NPO has no interest or has a minority interest, are not controlled entities under this Standard. It would be unusual for a controlling NPO to have power over other entities that do not provide a relevant return (either financial or non-financial). However, where this is the case, these entities are not controlled entities.

- AG1.12 Non-profit entities may have a participating interest in joint activities or hold a minority interest in an entity. In general, these participating and minority interests will not confer the required power to direct returns and therefore do not confer control.

- AG1.13 An NPO often collaborates with other NPOs in a co-operative and non-contractual way to further their respective purposes. While the effect of collaboration with entities with aligned or substantially the same objectives may result in similar returns to those that would be achieved through control, such voluntary arrangements do not represent control unless there are other factors that have the effect of conferring power.

- AG1.14 Therefore, there is no control relationship where:

- (a) an NPO has a voluntary collaboration agreement with another entity; or

- (b) there is a coincidence of activities with another entity; or

- (c) there is a joint arrangement with another entity where another entity has discretion as to the nature and extent of any benefit the controlling NPO might obtain.

This is because the NPO would not be exercising power over any of the entities to obtain benefit. Control arises where power is used to directly benefit a controlling NPO.

Determining whether consolidation of all entities is

- AG1.15 Full consolidation of all controlled entities provides a consistent basis for reporting and provides a consistent metric for the economic volume of group transactions and balances. These factors may be important for some readers of NPO financial statements, including institutional funders.

- AG1.16 Full consolidation may result in financial statements that are less understandable. This might be because there is information the statements do not provide, or perhaps because they are providing more information than is needed to the extent that key information is obscured.

- AG1.17 Exceptionally, paragraph G1.24 permits the exclusion of an entity from consolidation where it may provide the most relevant information available about a controlling NPO and its controlled entities. When making such a determination, the parent NPO should have regard to both the fundamental characteristics of relevance of the financial information provided by the consolidated financial statements, and the extent to which this achieves faithful representation.

- AG1.18 Faithful representation means that a depiction of relevant economic or other phenomena is sufficiently complete, neutral and free from error. In the context of consolidated financial statements, consolidation would be expected to provide a depiction that is complete and free from error. Although consolidation will not normally introduce bias, an NPO may wish to examine whether consolidation would result in a depiction that is not neutral.

- AG1.19 Financial information is relevant if it is capable of making a difference to the decisions made by users; that is, if it has predictive value which helps users consider likely outcomes or confirmatory value that provides feedback on previous considerations. An NPO shall consider the benefits of providing consolidated financial information, how it presents consolidated financial information in its financial statements to promote understandability and evidence to support the information needs of the users of its financial statements.

- AG1.20 When making a judgement about whether a controlled entity should be excluded from consolidation, an NPO should therefore have regard to the effect on the overall readability of financial reports for users of its financial statements. Judgements about the exclusion of an entity from consolidation must not be based on convenience and must be backed by evidence to support management’s judgement.

- AG1.21 Where an NPO does not consolidate a controlled entity, it is required to provide the disclosures in paragraph G1.25. In determining the information to be disclosed, the controlling NPO should draw on its analysis of the needs of the users of the financial statements that informed its judgement to exclude an entity. This analysis is expected to provide details of the judgements that the NPO has made about the information that users require to meet their needs. These information needs must be met through the disclosures.

Consolidation procedures

- AG1.22 Paragraph G1.26 sets out the procedures to be followed when producing consolidated financial statements. These procedures apply to the consolidation of the accumulated funds of any controlled entities. Where the entity being consolidated is a for-profit entity, accumulated

funds shall be included in unrestricted funds. Where the entity being consolidated is an NPO, their restricted funds are to be consolidated into the controlling NPO’s restricted funds, and their unrestricted funds are to be consolidated into the controlling NPO’s unrestricted funds. The notes to the financial statements shall disclose the restricted and unrestricted funds restrictions that belong to the controlling NPO separately from the controlled entities.

- AG1.23 Equity claims in the NPO context are not expected to be common. In the rare situations where a controlling NPO issues equity instruments, these will be shown as equity claims in the Statement of Financial Position. A more common situation will be where a controlling NPO holds equity instruments in for-profit entities, either to achieve a financial return or to help support the objectives of the controlling NPO; much less often, a controlling NPO may control an NPO through an equity interest. In either case, the controlling NPO’s investment or beneficial interest will be eliminated on consolidation with the controlled entity equity holdings. Where the controlled entity is 100 percent owned or controlled by the controlling NPO, these will exactly balance. Where there are other equity interests in the controlled entity, there will be a residual non-controlling interest.

- AG1.24 Where a controlling NPO is consolidating a for-profit entity, consideration will need to be given to any items that in a for-profit set of financial statements appear in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). INPAS covers the same transactions but requires that certain unrealised gains and losses be shown in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. A controlling NPO will need to map any items of OCI in for-profit financial statements to the correct financial statement. This will not impact either the carrying value or the accounting policy choice of the mapped item, only its location in the financial statements.

- AG1.25 Paragraphs G1.37–G1.40 provide that, if appropriate, group results should be allocated proportionally between controlling and non-controlling interests. This is intended to provide a split between results of the controlling NPO and any controlled entities, separate to the results of any interests that a controlling NPO may have in an entity that it doesn’t control. Given the focus of an NPO on furthering its objectives for public benefit, it is less likely that an NPO will have non-controlling interests in other entities, as it would not be able to affect the returns (non-financial benefits) in a way that would meet its objectives. It is possible that an NPO holds a non-controlling interest for purely financial return, but it is not anticipated that this will frequently occur. As a consequence, the requirements of paragraphs G1.36–G1.40 may not need to be frequently applied.

G2 – Investments in associates

Scope of this Section

- G2.1 This Section applies to accounting for associates in consolidated financial statements and in the financial statements of an investing NPO that is not a parent but that has a beneficial interest in one or more associates. Paragraph G1.47 establishes the requirements for accounting for associates in separate financial statements.

Associates defined

- G2.2 An associate is an entity, including an entity such as a partnership, over which the investing NPO has significant influence and that is neither a controlled entity nor an interest in a joint

arrangement.

- G2.3 Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the associate but is not control or joint control over those policies:

- (a) if an investing NPO holds, directly or indirectly (for example, through controlled entities), 20 percent or more of the voting power of the associate, it is presumed that the investing NPO has significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case;

- (b) conversely, if the investing NPO holds, directly or indirectly (for example, through controlled entities), less than 20 percent of the voting power of the associate, it is presumed that the investing NPO does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated; and

- (c) a substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not preclude an investing NPO from having significant influence.

Measurement – accounting policy election

- G2.4 An investing NPO shall account for all of its beneficial interest in associates using one of the following:

- (a) the cost model in paragraph G2.5;

- the equity method in paragraph G2.8; or

- (c) the fair value model in paragraph G2.9.

Cost model

- G2.5 An investing NPO shall measure its beneficial interests in associates, other than those for which there is a published price quotation (see paragraph G2.7), at cost less any accumulated impairment losses recognised in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets.

- The investing NPO shall recognise dividends and other distributions received from the beneficial interest as income without regard to whether the distributions are from accumulated surpluses of the associate arising before or after the date of acquisition.

- G2.7 An investing NPO shall measure its beneficial interests in associates for which there is a published price quotation using the fair value model (see paragraph G2.9).

Equity method

- Under the equity method of accounting, an equity investment is initially recognised at the transaction price (including transaction costs) and is subsequently adjusted to reflect the investing NPO’s share of the surplus or deficit and changes in net assets of the associate:

- (a) distributions and other adjustments to carrying amount. Distributions received from the associate reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be required as a consequence of changes in the associate’s equity or net assets as applicable arising from items that result in changes to net assets.

- (b) potential voting rights. Although potential voting rights are considered in deciding whether significant influence exists, an investing NPO shall measure its share of surplus or deficit and changes in net assets of the associate, and its share of changes in the associate’s equity or net assets, as applicable on the basis of present beneficial interests. Those measurements shall not reflect the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights.

- (c) implicit goodwill and fair value adjustments. On acquisition of the beneficial interest in an associate, an investing NPO shall account for any difference (whether positive or negative) between the cost of acquisition and the investing NPO’s share of the fair values of the net identifiable assets of the associate in accordance with paragraphs G4.23–G4.26 and G4.36. An investing NPO shall adjust its share of the associate’s surplus or deficit after acquisition to account for additional depreciation or amortisation of the associate’s depreciable or amortisable assets (including goodwill) on the basis of the excess of their fair values over their carrying amounts at the time the investment was acquired.

- (d) impairment. If there is an indication that an investment in an associate may be impaired, an investing NPO shall test the entire carrying amount of the investment, including financial instruments that in substance form part of the investing NPO’s net investment in the associate, for impairment in accordance with E5 as a single asset. A financial instrument for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, part of the investing NPO’s net investment (for example, may include preference shares or long-term receivables or loans). An investing NPO shall apply F1 Financial instruments to any such financial instrument before it applies this paragraph or paragraph G2.8(h). Any goodwill included as part of the carrying amount of the investment in the associate is not tested separately for impairment but instead as part of the test for impairment of the investment as a whole.

- (e) investing NPO’s transactions with associates. The investing NPO shall eliminate unrealised surplus or deficit resulting from upstream (associate to investing NPO) and downstream (investing NPO to associate) transactions to the extent of the investing NPO’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses on such transactions may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

- (f) date of associate’s financial statements. In applying the equity method, the investing NPO shall use the financial statements of the associate as of the same date as the financial statements of the investing NPO unless it is impracticable to do so. If it is impracticable, the investing NPO shall use the most recent available financial statements of the associate, with adjustments made for the effects of any significant transactions or events occurring between the accounting period ends.

- (g) associate’s accounting policies. If the associate uses accounting policies that differ from those of the investing NPO, the investing NPO shall adjust the associate’s financial statements to reflect the investing NPO’s accounting policies for the purpose of applying the equity method unless it is impracticable to do so.

- (h) losses in excess of investment. If an investing NPO’s share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds the carrying amount of its investment in the associate, the investing NPO

shall discontinue recognising its share of further deficit. The interest in an associate is the carrying amount of the investment determined using the equity method, together with any financial instruments that in substance form part of the investing NPO’s net investment in the associate (see paragraph G2.8(d)). After the investing NPO’s interest is reduced to zero, the investing NPO shall recognise additional deficits by a provision (see D5 Provisions and contingencies) only to the extent that the investing NPO has incurred legal or constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports surpluses, the investing NPO shall resume recognising its share of those surpluses only after its share of the surpluses equals the share of deficits not recognised.

- (i) discontinuing the equity method. An investing NPO shall cease using the equity method from the date that significant influence ceases:

- (i) if the associate becomes a controlled entity or a jointly controlled entity, the investing NPO shall remeasure its previously held equity interest to fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if any, in surplus or deficit.

- (ii) if an investing NPO loses significant influence over an associate as a result of a full or partial disposal, it shall derecognise that associate and recognise in surplus or deficit the difference between, on the one hand, the sum of the proceeds received plus the fair value of any retained interest and, on the other hand, the carrying amount of the investment in the associate at the date significant influence is lost. Thereafter, the investing NPO shall account for any retained interest using F1.

- (iii) if an investing NPO loses significant influence for reasons other than a partial disposal of its investment, the investing NPO shall regard the carrying amount of the investment at that date as a new cost basis and shall account for the investment using F1.

Fair value model

- G2.9 When an investment in an associate is recognised initially, an investing NPO shall measure it at the transaction price. Transaction price excludes transaction costs.

- At each reporting date, an investing NPO shall measure its investments in associates at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit using the fair value measurement guidance in A4 Fair value measurement. An investing NPO using the fair value model shall use the cost model for any investment in an associate for which fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.

Financial statement presentation

- G2.11 An investing NPO shall classify investments in associates as non-current assets.

Disclosures

- G2.12 An NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) its accounting policy for investments in associates;

- (b) the carrying amount of investments in associates (see paragraph B2.2(k)); and

- (c) the fair value of its investment in an associate if a market price for the investment is quoted and the NPO accounts for the associate using the equity method.

- G2.13 For investments in associates accounted for using the cost model, an investing NPO shall disclose the amount of dividends and other distributions recognised as income.

- G2.14 For investments in associates accounted for using the equity method, an investing NPO shall disclose separately its share of the surplus or deficit and its share of any discontinued operations.

- G2.15 For investments in associates accounted for using the fair value model, an investing NPO shall make the disclosures required in A4. If an investing NPO applies the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph G2.10 for any associates, it shall disclose that fact, the reasons why fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort and the carrying amount of investments in associates accounted for under the cost model.

G3 – Joint arrangements

Scope of this Section

- This Section applies to accounting for joint arrangements in consolidated financial statements and in the financial statements of an investing NPO that is not a controlling NPO but that has one or more joint arrangements. This Section also establishes requirements for a party that participates in but does not have joint control in a joint arrangement. Paragraph G1.47 establishes the requirements for accounting for a jointly controlled entity in separate financial statements.

Joint arrangements defined

- G3.2 A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

- G3.3 An NPO that is a party to an arrangement shall assess whether the contractual arrangement gives all the parties, or a group of the parties, control of the arrangement collectively. All the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively when they must act together to direct the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement (that is, the relevant activities). Once it has been determined that all the parties, or a group of the parties, control the arrangement collectively, joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that control the arrangement collectively.

- G3.4 Joint arrangements can take the form of jointly controlled operations, jointly controlled assets or jointly controlled entities.

Jointly controlled operations

- The operation of some joint arrangements involves the use of the assets and other resources of the parties to the joint arrangement instead of the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity, or a financial structure that is separate from the parties themselves. Each party uses its own property, plant and equipment and carries its own inventories. It also incurs its own expenses and liabilities and raises its own finance, which represent its own obligations. The joint arrangement activities may be carried out by the party’s employees alongside the party’s similar activities. The joint arrangement agreement usually provides a means by which the revenue from the sale of the joint product and any expenses that are common to the parties be shared among them.

- G3.6 In respect of its interests in jointly controlled operations, an NPO shall recognise in its financial statements:

- (a) the assets that it controls and the liabilities that it incurs; and

- (b) the expenses that it incurs and its share of the revenue that it earns from the sale of goods or services by the joint arrangement.

Jointly controlled assets

- G3.7 Some joint arrangements involve the joint control, and often the joint ownership, by the parties of one or more assets contributed to, or acquired for the purpose of, the joint arrangement and dedicated to the purposes of the joint arrangement.

- G3.8 In respect of its interest in a jointly controlled asset, an NPO shall recognise in its financial statements:

- (a) its share of the jointly controlled assets, classified according to the nature of the assets;

- (b) any liabilities that it has incurred;

- (c) its share of any liabilities incurred jointly with the other parties in relation to the joint arrangement;

- (d) any revenue from the sale or use of its share of the output of the joint arrangement, together with its share of any expenses incurred by the joint arrangement; and

- (e) any expenses that it has incurred in respect of its interest in the joint arrangement.

Jointly controlled entities

- A jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement that involves the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity in which each party has an interest. The entity operates in the same way as other entities, except that an arrangement between the parties establishes joint control.

Measurement – accounting policy election

- G3.10 An NPO that has joint control shall account for all of its investments in jointly controlled entities using one of the following:

- (a) the cost model in paragraph G3.11;

- (b) the equity method in paragraph G3.14; or

- (c) the fair value model in paragraph G3.15.

Cost model

- G3.11 An NPO that has joint control shall measure its beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities, other than those for which there is a published price quotation (see paragraph G3.13), at cost less any accumulated impairment losses recognised in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets.

- G3.12 The NPO that has joint control shall recognise distributions received from the beneficial interest as income without regard to whether the distributions are from accumulated surpluses of the jointly controlled entity arising before or after the date of acquisition.

- G3.13 Applying the cost model in paragraph G3.11, an NPO that has joint control shall measure its beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities for which there is a published price quotation using the fair value model (see paragraph G3.15).

Equity method

- G3.14 An NPO that has joint control shall measure its beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method following the procedures in paragraph G2.8 (substituting ‘joint control’ where that paragraph refers to ‘significant influence’).

Fair value model

- G3.15 When a beneficial interest in a jointly controlled entity is recognised initially, an NPO that has joint control shall measure it at transaction price. Transaction price excludes transaction costs.

- At each reporting date, an NPO that has joint control shall measure its beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit, using the fair value measurement guidance in A4 Fair value measurement. An NPO using the fair value model shall use the cost model for any beneficial interest in a jointly controlled NPO for which fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort.

Transactions between a party to the joint arrangement with joint control and a joint arrangement

- G3.17 When an NPO that is a party to the joint arrangement that has joint control contributes or sells assets to a joint arrangement, recognition of any portion of a gain or loss from the transaction shall reflect the substance of the transaction. While the assets are retained by the joint arrangement and provided the party to the joint arrangement has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership, the NPO shall recognise only that portion of the gain or loss that is attributable to the interests of the other parties. The NPO shall recognise the full amount of any deficit when the contribution or sale provides evidence of an impairment loss.

- G3.18 When an NPO that is a party to the joint arrangement that has joint control purchases assets from a joint arrangement, that NPO shall not recognise its share of the surpluses of the joint arrangement from the transaction until it resells the assets to an independent party. An NPO to the joint arrangement shall recognise its share of the deficits resulting from these transactions in the same way as surpluses, except that deficits shall be recognised immediately when they represent an impairment loss.

If an NPO does not have joint control

- G3.19 An NPO that participates in but does not have joint control of a jointly controlled entity shall account for its interest in the arrangement in accordance with F1 Financial instruments, unless it has significant influence over the jointly controlled entity, in which case it shall account for the interest in the arrangement in accordance with G2 Investments in associates.

- G3.20 An NPO that participates in but does not have joint control of a jointly controlled operation shall account for its interest in the arrangement in accordance with paragraph G3.6.

- G3.21 An NPO that participates in but does not have joint control of jointly controlled assets shall account for its interest in the arrangement in accordance with paragraph G3.8.

Disclosures

- G3.22 An NPO shall disclose the following:

- (a) the accounting policy it uses for recognising its interests in jointly controlled NPOs;

- (b) the carrying amount of beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities (see paragraph B2.2(l));

- (c) the fair value of its beneficial interests in a jointly controlled entity if a market price for the beneficial interest is quoted and the NPO accounts for the jointly controlled entities using the equity method; and

- (d) the aggregate amount of its commitments relating to jointly controlled entities, including its share in the commitments that have been incurred jointly with other parties.

- G3.23 For jointly controlled entities accounted for using the equity method, an NPO that has joint control shall also make the disclosures required by paragraph G2.14 for equity method investments.

- G3.24 For jointly controlled entities accounted for using the fair value model, an NPO that has joint control shall make the disclosures required in A4. If an NPO applies the undue cost or effort exemption in paragraph G3.16 for any jointly controlled entity, it shall disclose that fact, the reasons why fair value measurement would involve undue cost or effort and the carrying amount of beneficial interests in jointly controlled entities accounted for under the cost model.

G4 – Business combinations and goodwill

Scope of this Section

- G4.1 This Section applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of business combination. It sets out requirements for how an acquiring NPO recognises and measures in its financial statements:

- (a) the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and

- (b) the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase.

- G4.2 This Section does not apply to:

- (a) combinations of entities or businesses under common control. Common control means that all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory.

- (b) formations of a joint arrangement in the financial statements of the joint arrangement itself.

- (c) acquisitions of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business.

- G4.3 The terms ‘business’ and ‘business combination’ are used in this Section to define specific transactions and how recognition and measurement principles apply to such transactions. NPOs are characterised in A1 NPOs. This Section does not supersede the guidance in A1.

Identifying a business combination

- G4.4 An NPO shall determine whether a transaction or other event meets the definition of a business combination. A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquiring NPO (the acquirer) obtains control of one or more businesses (the acquiree). Paragraphs AG4.1–AG4.11 provide guidance on how to determine whether the transaction or other event is a business combination. If the assets acquired and liabilities assumed do not constitute a business, the reporting NPO shall account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition.

- G4.5 An acquiring NPO might obtain control of an acquiree in various ways – for example, by:

- (a) transferring cash, cash equivalents or other assets (including net assets that constitute a business);

- (b) incurring liabilities;

- (c) issuing equity instruments;

- (d) providing more than one type of consideration;

- (e) obtaining powers to appoint and/or remove a majority of an NPO’s governing board; or

- (f) entering into a formal agreement for transfer.

- A business combination might be structured in various ways for legal, taxation or other reasons. Examples of these structures include transactions or other events in which:

- (a) one or more businesses become subsidiaries of an acquiring NPO or the net assets of one or more businesses are legally merged into the acquiring NPO;

- (b) one combining entity transfers its net assets, or its owners transfer their equity instruments, to another combining entity or its owners;

- (c) all of the combining entities transfer their net assets, or the owners of those entities transfer their equity interests, to a newly formed entity;

- (d) a group of former owners of one of the combining entities obtains control of the combined entity; or

- (e) any of the above combinations in relation to an NPO (or multiple NPOs).

Accounting for business combinations and goodwill

- G4.7 An NPO shall account for each combination by applying the acquisition method.

- G4.8 To apply the acquisition method, an NPO shall:

- (a) identify the acquiring NPO;

- (b) identify the acquisition date;

- (c) recognise and measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; and

- (d) recognise and measure goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.

Identifying the acquiring NPO

- G4.9 For each business combination, one of the combining entities shall be identified as the acquirer.

- G4.10 G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements shall be used to identify the acquiring NPO – that is, to identify the entity that obtains control of the acquiree.

- G4.11 If an NPO applying G1 is not able to clearly identify which of the combining entities is the acquirer, the NPO shall consider the factors in paragraphs AG4.12–AG4.16 to make that determination.

Identifying the acquisition date

- G4.12 The acquiring NPO shall identify the acquisition date – that is, the date on which it obtains control of the acquiree.

Recognising and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree

Recognition principle

- At the acquisition date, the acquiring NPO shall recognise, separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, except as specified in paragraphs G4.17–G4.22. An acquiring NPO shall recognise the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed only if they:

- (a) meet the definitions of assets and liabilities in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles at the acquisition date; and

- (b) are part of what the acquiring NPO and the acquiree (or the acquiree’s former owners) exchanged in the business combination transaction rather than the result of separate transactions (see paragraph G4.34). The acquiring NPO and the acquiree might enter into separate transactions before or during the negotiations for the business combination that are not part of what is exchanged in the business combination. These separate transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable sections of this Standard.

Measurement principle

- G4.14 The acquiring NPO shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, except as specified in paragraphs G4.17–G4.22.

- G4.15 For each business combination, the acquiring NPO shall measure at the acquisition date any non-controlling interests in the acquiree at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Exceptions to the recognition or measurement principles

- G4.16 Paragraphs G4.17–G4.22 provide exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles set out in paragraphs G4.13–G4.15 and specify both the items for which exceptions are provided and the nature of those exceptions.

- G4.17 An acquiring NPO shall recognise an intangible asset acquired in a business combination, if the asset meets the recognition principles set out in E4 Intangible assets other than goodwill, and the asset’s fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date.

- If an acquiring NPO assumes a liability or contingent liability in a business combination and that liability or contingent liability would have been within the scope of D5 Provisions and contingencies had the acquiring NPO incurred it separately, the acquiring NPO shall apply paragraph D5.7 to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date as a result of past events.

- G4.19 If an acquiring NPO determines, in accordance with paragraph G4.18, that a present obligation exists, the acquiring NPO shall recognise a contingent liability at the acquisition date if:

- (a) the present obligation meets the definition of a contingent liability in accordance with paragraph D5.15.

- (b) the fair value of the contingent liability can be measured reliably.

- G4.20 Therefore, the acquiring NPO recognises a contingent liability assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that the acquiring NPO will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the present obligation. The acquiring NPO does not apply the recognition requirements in paragraphs D5.5(b) and D5.15 to a contingent liability assumed in a business combination.

- G4.21 An acquiring NPO shall recognise and measure in accordance with D8 Income tax a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability arising from the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

- G4.22 An acquiring NPO shall recognise and measure in accordance with D4 Employee benefits a liability (or asset, if any) related to the acquiree’s employee benefit arrangements.

Recognising and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase

- G4.23 The acquiring NPO shall recognise goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (a) over (b):

- (a) the sum of:

- (i) the consideration transferred measured in accordance with paragraph G4.27;

- (ii) the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance

- (iii) the acquisition date fair value of the acquiring NPO’s previously held interest in the acquiree in the case of a business combination achieved in stages (see paragraphs G4.31-G4.32).

- (b) the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed measured in accordance with paragraphs G4.14–G4.22.

Bargain purchases

- G4.24 An acquiring NPO may make a bargain purchase – a business combination in which the amount in paragraph G4.23(b) exceeds the sum of the amounts specified in paragraph G4.23(a). If an excess remains after an acquiring NPO applies paragraph G4.26, the acquiring NPO shall recognise the resulting gain in surplus or deficit on the acquisition date. The gain shall be attributed to the acquiring NPO.

- G4.25 If two NPOs combine that both have positive net assets at the date they are combined, the requirements of G4.26 do not apply.

- G4.26 Before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquiring NPO shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities identified in that reassessment. The acquiring NPO shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts required to be recognised at the acquisition date for:

- (a) the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed;

- (b) the acquiring NPO’s previously held interest in the acquiree; in the case of a business combination achieved in stages; and

- (c) the consideration transferred.

Consideration transferred

- An acquiring NPO shall measure the consideration transferred in a business combination at fair value. The acquiring NPO shall calculate the consideration transferred as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquiring NPO, the liabilities incurred by the acquiring NPO to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity instruments issued by the acquiring NPO. Examples of consideration include cash, other assets, a business or a controlled entity of the acquiring NPO, contingent consideration, ordinary or preference equity instruments, options and warrants. For an NPO, this also includes a formal transfer agreement or agreements to exchange service potential.

Contingent consideration

- The consideration an acquiring NPO transfers in exchange for an acquiree includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement (see paragraph G4.27). The acquiring NPO shall recognise the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration as part of the consideration transferred in exchange for the acquiree if the fair value of the contingent consideration can be reliably measured without undue cost or effort.

- G4.29 If the acquiring NPO cannot reliably measure the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date without undue cost or effort, it shall measure the contingent consideration at the acquisition date using the most likely amount of consideration. Subsequently, the acquiring NPO shall not reassess whether measuring the fair value of contingent consideration involves undue cost or effort (see paragraph G4.39(b)).

- The acquiring NPO shall apply F2 Liabilities and equity claims to classify an obligation to pay contingent consideration that is a financial instrument as a financial liability or as an equity claim. An acquiring NPO shall classify a right to the return of previously transferred consideration as an asset. Paragraphs G4.38–G4.39 set out the requirements for accounting for contingent consideration.

A business combination achieved in stages

- G4.31 An acquiring NPO sometimes obtains control of an acquiree in which it held an interest immediately before the acquisition date. In such cases, the acquiring NPO shall remeasure its previously held interest in the acquiree at its acquisition date fair value and recognise the resulting gain or loss, if any, in surplus or deficit.

- G4.32 If a party to a joint arrangement obtains control of a business that is a jointly controlled operation or a jointly controlled asset immediately before the acquisition date, the transaction is a business combination achieved in stages (a step acquisition). The acquiring NPO shall apply the requirements for a business combination achieved in stages in accordance with paragraph G4.31, including remeasuring its entire previously held interest in the jointly controlled operation or the jointly controlled asset.

Measurement period

- If an acquiring NPO’s initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the acquiring NPO shall recognise in its financial statements provisional amounts for the items for which its accounting is incomplete. Within twelve months after the acquisition date, the acquiring NPO shall retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts it recognised as assets and liabilities and recognise any additional assets and liabilities to reflect new information it obtained about any relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Any adjustments affect the goodwill acquired or any gain from a bargain purchase. After more than twelve months have passed since the acquisition date, the acquiring NPO shall recognise adjustments to the initial accounting for a business combination only if correcting an error in accordance with B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors.

Acquisition-related costs

- Acquisition-related costs are costs an acquiring NPO incurs to effect a business combination. The acquiring NPO shall account for acquisition-related costs separately from the business combination as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received, with two exceptions: the acquiring NPO shall recognise the cost to issue debt in accordance with F1 and the cost to issue equity instruments in accordance with F2.

Subsequent measurement and accounting

- G4.35 After initial recognition, an acquiring NPO shall apply the applicable sections of this Standard to assets acquired, liabilities assumed or incurred and equity instruments issued in a business combination. After initial recognition, paragraphs G4.36–G4.39 apply to:

- (a) goodwill;

- (b) contingent liabilities recognised as of the acquisition date; and

- (c) contingent consideration.

Goodwill

- G4.36 After an acquiring NPO initially recognises goodwill acquired in a business combination, the acquiring NPO shall measure it at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The acquiring NPO shall apply:

- (a) paragraphs E4.19–E4.25 for amortisation of goodwill. If the acquiring NPO cannot reliably establish the useful life of goodwill, it shall use its best estimate of the life, but that estimate shall not exceed ten years.

- (b) E5 Impairment of assets to recognise and measure any impairment of goodwill.

Contingent liabilities

- G4.37 After an acquiring NPO initially recognises a contingent liability in a business combination and until the liability is settled, cancelled or expires, it shall measure the liability at the higher of:

- (a) the amount that the acquiring NPO would have recognised in accordance with D5; or

- the amount the acquiring NPO initially recognised minus, if appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of C1 Revenue.

Contingent consideration

- Changes resulting from events after the acquisition date (such as meeting a fundraising target or reaching a milestone on a research and development project) are not measurement period adjustments, except for the changes in the amount of contingent consideration that are measurement period adjustments in accordance with paragraph G4.33. The acquiring NPO shall account for changes in the amount of contingent consideration that are not measurement period adjustments in accordance with paragraph G4.39.

- G4.39 If the contingent consideration is:

- (a) classified as equity, the acquiring NPO shall not remeasure that contingent consideration and shall account for its subsequent settlement within equity claims.

- (b) other contingent consideration:

- (i) whose fair value can be measured reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date, the acquiring NPO shall measure that contingent consideration at fair value at each reporting date and shall recognise in surplus or deficit any changes in fair value.

- (ii) whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort at the acquisition date (see paragraph G4.29), the acquiring NPO shall review that contingent consideration at each reporting date and adjust it to reflect the current estimate of the most likely amount of the contingent consideration at that reporting date. The acquiring NPO shall recognise in surplus or deficit any adjustments to the amounts it previously recognised.

Disclosures

For business combination(s) during the reporting period

- G4.40 For each business combination that occurs during the reporting period, the acquiring NPO shall disclose:

- (a) the name and a description of the acquiree;

- (b) the acquisition date;

- the percentage of voting equity instruments acquired;

- (d) the acquisition date fair value of the total consideration transferred and a description of the components of that consideration (such as cash, equity instruments and debt instruments);

- for contingent consideration arrangements:

- (i) the amount recognised as of the acquisition date;

- (ii) a description of the arrangement and the basis for determining the amount of the payment; and

- (iii) if applicable the fact that the acquiring NPO cannot reliably measure the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration without undue cost or effort (see paragraph G4.29) and the reasons it would involve undue cost or effort.

- (f) the amounts recognised at the acquisition date for each class of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities;

- (g) for a bargain purchase, the amount of any surplus recognised in surplus or deficit in accordance with paragraph G4.24 and the line item in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets or Statement of Income and Expenses in which the gain is recognised;

- (h) a qualitative description of the factors that make up the goodwill recognised – for example, expected synergies from combining operations of the acquiree and the acquiring NPO – or intangible assets not recognised in accordance with paragraph G4.17; and

- (i) the information required by paragraph D5.18 for each contingent liability that the acquiring NPO does not recognise in accordance with paragraph G4.19 (because its fair value cannot be measured reliably).

For all business combinations

- G4.41 An acquiring NPO shall disclose the useful lives used to amortise goodwill and a reconciliation of the carrying amount of goodwill at the beginning and end of the reporting period. The acquiring NPO shall disclose separately:

- (a) additional goodwill it recognised during the reporting period arising from new business combinations;

- (b) impairment losses it recognised during the reporting period in accordance with E5;

- (c) goodwill relating to previously acquired businesses the acquiring NPO derecognised during the reporting period; and

- (d) other changes.

- G4.42 The reconciliation set out in paragraph G4.41 need not be presented for prior periods.

For reporting periods after the acquisition date

- For each reporting period after the acquisition date until the NPO collects, sells or otherwise loses the right to a contingent consideration asset, or until the NPO settles a contingent consideration liability or the liability is cancelled or expires, the NPO shall disclose for each material business combination and in aggregate for business combinations that are individually immaterial but collectively material:

- (a) any changes in the recognised amounts of contingent consideration, including any differences arising upon settlement; and

- (b) the valuation techniques and key model inputs the acquiring NPO used to measure contingent consideration.

Application Guidance G4 – Business combinations and goodwill

Definition of a business (application of paragraph G4.4)

- A business is an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities. A business consists of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. These are the three elements of a business and their definitions:

- (a) an input is any economic resource that creates outputs or has the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs when one or more processes are applied to it. Examples of inputs include employees, noncurrent assets, intellectual property, and the ability to obtain access to necessary materials or rights.

- (b) a process is any system, standard, protocol, convention or rule that when applied to an input or inputs creates outputs or has the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. Examples of processes include strategic management processes, operational processes and resource management processes.

- (c) an output is the result of inputs and processes applied to those inputs that provide goods, services or other activities aligned with the missional objectives of the NPO to service beneficiaries and customers, generate investment income or generate other income from ordinary activities.

- AG4.2 A business will exist where these criteria are met regardless of the size of the inputs, processes or outputs further described in AG4.5. The requirements of this Section will therefore apply to all businesses of all sizes, including small businesses.

Optional test to identify concentration of fair value

- AG4.3 Paragraph AG4.4 sets out an optional concentration test for a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business. An NPO is permitted to choose whether to apply the test for each transaction or other event. If the concentration test is:

- (a) met, the set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business and no further assessment is necessary; or

- (b) not met (or if the NPO chooses not to apply the test), the NPO then performs the assessment set out in paragraphs AG4.5–AG4.11.

- The concentration test is met, meaning an acquired set of activities and assets is determined not to be a business, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. For the purposes of the concentration test:

- (a) gross assets acquired exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and goodwill resulting from the effects of deferred tax liabilities;

- (b) the fair value of the gross assets acquired includes any consideration transferred (plus the noncontrolling interest’s proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets and the fair value of any previously held interest) in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired;

- (c) a single identifiable asset includes any asset or group of assets that would be recognised and measured as a single identifiable asset in a business combination;

- (d) if a tangible asset is attached to, and cannot be physically removed and used separately from, another tangible asset without incurring significant cost or significant diminution in utility or fair value to either asset (for example, land and buildings), those assets shall be considered a single identifiable asset; and

- (e) the nature of each single identifiable asset and the risk characteristics (the risks associated with managing and creating outputs from the assets) are considered to assess whether assets are similar.

Elements of a business

- Although businesses usually have outputs, an integrated set of activities and assets can have no outputs and still qualify as a business. If an integrated set of activities and assets has two essential elements – inputs and processes applied to those inputs – it can be conducted and managed for the purposes identified in the definition of a business. A business need not include all of the inputs or processes that were used in operating that business. However, to be considered a business, an integrated set of activities and assets includes, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Paragraphs AG4.8–AG4.11 specify how to assess whether a process is substantive.

- AG4.6 If an acquired set of activities and assets has outputs, a continuation of revenue does not on its own show that the acquiring NPO has acquired both an input and a substantive process.

- AG4.7 An acquiring NPO determines whether a particular set of activities and assets a business based on whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant. It is not relevant whether a seller operated the set as a business or whether an acquiring NPO intends to operate the set as a business. is

Assessing whether an acquired process is substantive

- AG4.8 Paragraphs AG4.9–AG4.11 explain how to assess whether an acquired process substantive depending on whether the acquired set of activities and assets has no outputs (paragraph AG4.10) or has outputs (paragraph AG4.11). Figure AG4.1 summarises how an NPO assesses whether an acquired process is substantive. is

- AG4.9 An example of an acquired set of activities and assets that does not have outputs at the acquisition date is an early-stage entity that has not started generating revenue. If an acquired set of activities and assets generates revenue at the acquisition date, it is considered to have outputs at that date. The acquired set has outputs even if it subsequently will no longer generate revenue from external customers – for example, because it will be integrated by the acquiring NPO.

- AG4.10 If a set of activities and assets does not have outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of processes) is considered substantive only if:

- (a) it is critical to the ability to develop or convert an acquired input or inputs into outputs; and

- the inputs acquired include both access to an organised workforce that has the necessary skills, knowledge or experience to perform that process (or group of processes) and other inputs that the organised workforce could develop or convert into outputs. Those other inputs could include:

- (i) intellectual property that could be used to develop a good or service;

- (ii) other economic resources – for example, technology or real estate – that could be developed to create outputs; or

- (iii) rights to obtain access to necessary materials or rights that enable the creation of future outputs.

Examples of the inputs mentioned in subparagraphs (b)(i)–(iii) include technology, in-process research and development projects and real estate.

- AG4.11 If a set of activities and assets has outputs at the acquisition date, an acquired process (or group of processes) is considered substantive if, when applied to an acquired input or inputs, it:

- (a) is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include access to an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge or experience to perform that process (or group of processes); or

- (b) significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and:

- (i) is considered unique or scarce; or

- (ii) cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

Identifying the acquirer (application of paragraphs G4.9-G4.11)

- AG4.12 In a business combination effected primarily by transferring cash or other assets or by incurring liabilities, the acquirer is usually the entity that transfers the cash or other assets or incurs the liabilities.

- AG4.13 In a business combination effected primarily by exchanging equity instruments, the acquirer is usually the entity that issues its equity instruments. An NPO considers other pertinent facts and circumstances to identify the acquirer in a business combination effected by exchanging equity instruments. For example, the acquirer is usually the combining entity:

- (a) whose owners as a group retain or receive after the business combination the largest portion of the voting rights in the combined entity;

- (b) whose single owner or organised group of owners holds the largest minority voting interest in the combined entity if no other owner or organised group of owners has a significant voting interest;

- (c) whose owners have the ability to elect, appoint or remove a majority of the members of the governing body of the combined entity;

- (d) whose (former) management dominates the senior management of the combined entity; or

- (e) that pays a premium over the precombination fair value of the equity instruments of the other combining entity or entities.

- AG4.14 The acquirer is usually the combining entity whose size (measured in, for example, assets, revenues or profit) is significantly greater than that of the other combining entity or entities.

- AG4.15 In a business combination involving more than two entities, an NPO identifies the acquirer by considering, among other things, which of the combining entities initiated the combination and the relative size of the combining entities.

- AG4.16 A new entity formed to effect a business combination is not necessarily the acquirer. If a new entity is formed to issue equity instruments to effect a business combination, one of the combining entities that existed before the business combination is the acquirer in accordance with paragraph G4.11 and the guidance in paragraphs AG4.12–AG4.15. In contrast, a new entity that transfers cash or other assets or incurs liabilities as consideration might be the acquirer.

H1 – Related party disclosures

Scope of this Section

- This Section requires an NPO to include in its financial statements the disclosures necessary to draw attention to the possibility that its financial position and surplus or deficit have been affected by the existence of related parties and by transactions and outstanding balances with such parties.

Related party defined

- H1.2 A related party is a person or entity that is related to the reporting NPO:

(a) a person or a close member of that person’s family is related to a reporting NPO if that person:

- (i) is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting NPO or of an entity that controls the reporting NPO;

- (ii) is a member of the reporting NPO’s governing body (paid or not) which provides oversight of the NPO’s activities;

- (iii) has control or joint control over the reporting NPO; or

- (iv) has significant influence over the reporting NPO.

- (b) an entity is related to a reporting NPO if any of the following conditions apply:

- (i) the entity and the reporting NPO are members of the same group (which means that each controlling NPO and any controlled entity is related to the others).

- (ii) one entity is an associate or jointly controlled by the reporting NPO (or an associate or jointly controlled entity of a member of a group of which the reporting NPO is a member).

- (iii) both entities are jointly controlled entities of the same third entity.

- (iv) one entity is a jointly controlled entity of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.

- (v) the entity is a post-employment benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting NPO or an entity related to the reporting NPO. If the reporting NPO is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting NPO.

- (vi) the NPO is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).

- (vii) the entity, or any member of a group of which it is a part, provides key management personnel services to the reporting NPO or to the parent of the reporting NPO.

- (viii) a person identified in (a)(iii) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).

- H1.3 In considering each possible related party relationship, an NPO shall assess the substance of the relationship and not merely the legal form. This includes an assessment of the characteristics of the NPO’s governance arrangements.

- H1.4 In the context of this Standard, the following are not necessarily related parties:

- (a) two NPOs simply because they have members of key management personnel in common;

- (b) two parties simply because they share joint control over a jointly controlled NPO;

- (c) any of the following simply by virtue of their normal dealings with an entity (even though they may affect the freedom of action of an NPO or participate in its decision-making process):

- (i) providers of finance;

- (ii) trade unions;

- (iii) public utilities; or

- (iv) government departments and agencies; or

- (d) a customer, grantor, supplier, franchisor, distributor or general agent with whom an NPO transacts a significant volume of business, merely by virtue of the resulting economic dependence.

Disclosures

Disclosure of controlling party relationships

- Relationships between a controlling NPO and its controlled entities shall be disclosed irrespective of whether there have been related party transactions. An NPO shall disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling party. If neither the NPO’s parent nor the ultimate controlling party produces financial statements available for public use, the name of the next most senior parent that does so (if any) shall also be disclosed.

Disclosure of key management personnel compensation

- H1.6 Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the NPO, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of that NPO. Compensation includes all employee benefits (as defined in D4 Employee benefits). Employee benefits include all forms of consideration paid, payable or provided by the NPO, or on behalf of the NPO (for example, by its parent), in exchange for services rendered to the NPO. It also includes such consideration paid on behalf of a parent of the NPO in respect of goods or services provided to the NPO.

- H1.7 An NPO shall disclose key management personnel compensation in total.

Disclosure of governing body member compensation

- H1.8 Governing body members are those persons having authority and responsibility for oversight of the NPO’s activities (whether paid or not). Compensation includes all employee benefits (as defined in D4). Employee benefits include all forms of consideration paid, payable or provided by the NPO or on behalf of the NPO (for example, by its parent) in exchange for services rendered to the NPO. It also includes such consideration paid on behalf of a parent of the NPO in respect of goods or services provided to the NPO.

- H1.9 A disclosure shall be made in the notes to the financial statements that either:

- (a) none of the members of the governing body have been paid any compensation (see paragraph H1.8) or benefits from employment with the NPO, or

- (b) one or more of the members of the governing body has been paid compensation or other benefits from employment with the NPO.

- H1.10 Where H1.9(b) is required to be followed, the disclosure shall include:

- (a) who was paid and the nature of the work for which they were paid;

- the amounts paid broken down into salary, pension, other benefits;

- (c) the legal arrangement for payment – employment or self-employed services – and how this is distinguished from any governance role within the NPO; and

- (d) confirmation that the NPO is allowed to make such payments under law/constitution.

- H1.11 Where any member of the governing body has claimed expenses, then the disclosure shall include:

- (a) how many members have been paid; and

- (b) the value of expenses paid where material, with disclosure of expenses by natural category.

- An NPO that obtains key management personnel services from another entity (management entity) is not required to make any disclosure that might otherwise be required by paragraph H1.7 in relation to the compensation paid or payable by the management entity to the management entity’s employees or directors. However, the amounts incurred by an NPO for the provision by a separate management entity of such services shall be disclosed.

Disclosure of related party transactions

- H1.13 A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between a reporting NPO and a related party, regardless of whether a price is charged. Examples of related party transactions that are common to NPOs include but are not limited to:

- (a) transactions between an NPO and those that have equity claims;

- (b) transactions between an NPO and another entity when both entities are under the common control of a single entity or person; and

- (c) transactions in which an entity or governing body member and/or key management personnel of the reporting NPO incurs expenses directly that otherwise would have been borne by the reporting NPO.

- If an NPO has related party transactions, it shall disclose the nature of the related party relationship as well as information about the transactions, outstanding balances and commitments necessary for an understanding of the potential effect of the relationship on the financial statements. Those disclosure requirements are in addition to the requirements in paragraph H1.7 and H1.9–H1.10 to disclose key management personnel and governing body member compensation including expenses. As a minimum, disclosures shall include:

- (a) the amount of the transactions;

- the amount of outstanding balances, including commitments and:

- (i) their terms and conditions, including whether they are secured and the nature of the consideration to be provided in settlement; and

- (ii) details of any guarantees given or received.

- (c) provisions for uncollectable receivables related to the amount of outstanding balances; and

- (d) the expense recognised during the period in respect of bad or doubtful debts due from related parties.

Such transactions could include income or expense items, transfers (or donations) of goods, services; leases; guarantees; and settlements by the NPO on behalf of the related party or vice versa.

- H1.15 An NPO shall make the disclosures required by paragraph H1.14 separately for each of the following categories:

- (a) entities or individuals with control, joint control or significant influence over the NPO;

- (b) entities over which the NPO has control, joint control or significant influence;

- (c) key management personnel and governing body members of the NPO or its parent (in the aggregate); and

- (d) other related parties.

- H1.16 An NPO is exempt from the disclosure requirements of paragraph H1.14 in relation to related party transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, with:

- (a) a government that has control, joint control or significant influence over the reporting NPO; and

- (b) another entity that is a related party because the same government has control, joint control or significant influence over both the reporting NPO and the other entity.

- H1.17 The following are examples of transactions that shall be disclosed if they are with a related party:

- (a) purchases or sales of goods (finished or unfinished);

- (b) donations;

- (c) purchases or sales of property and other assets;

- (d) rendering or receiving of services;

- (e) leases;

- (f) transfers of research and development;

- (g) transfers under licence agreements;

- (h) transfers under finance arrangements (including loans and equity contributions in cash or in kind);

- (i) provision of guarantees or collateral;

- (j) commitments to do something if a particular event occurs or does not occur in the future;

- (k) settlement of liabilities on behalf of the NPO or by the NPO on behalf of another party; and

- (l) participation in a defined benefit plan that shares risks between the reporting NPO and other entities in the group.

- H1.18 Transactions with a governing body member need not be disclosed where the governing body member is a recipient of services made in accordance with the NPO’s primary purpose, where the services are provided on the same terms as other eligible service recipients. Amounts owed by governing body members at the financial reporting date need not be disclosed if the governing body member has not exceeded the terms provided to other eligible service recipients. A list of governing body members that are in receipt of services shall be provided, with the nature of the service provided.

- H1.19 An NPO shall not state that related party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s-length transactions unless such terms can be substantiated.

- H1.20 An NPO may disclose items of a similar nature in the aggregate except when separate disclosure is necessary for an understanding of the effects of related party transactions on the financial statements of the NPO.

- H1.21 If a reporting NPO applies the exemption in paragraph H1.16, it shall disclose the following about the transactions and related outstanding balances referred to in paragraph H1.16:

- (a) the name of the government and the nature of its relationship with the reporting NPO (that is, control, joint control or significant influence);

- (b) the nature and amount of each individually significant transaction;

- (c) for other transactions that are collectively but not individually significant, a qualitative or quantitative indication of their extent. Types of transactions include those listed in paragraph H1.17.

H2 – Hyperinflation

Scope of this Section

- H2.1 This Section applies to an NPO whose functional currency is the currency of a hyper- inflationary economy. It requires such an NPO to prepare financial statements that have been adjusted for the effects of hyperinflation.

Hyperinflationary economy

- H2.2 This Section does not establish an absolute rate at which an economy is deemed hyperinflationary. An NPO shall make that judgement by considering all available information, including but not limited to the following possible indicators of hyperinflation:

- (a) the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power.

- (b) the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency.

- (c) sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short.

- (d) interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index.

- the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching or exceeds 100 percent.

Measuring unit in the financial statements

- H2.3 All amounts in the financial statements of an NPO whose functional currency is the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy shall be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. The comparative information for the previous period required by paragraph B1.16 and any information presented in respect of earlier periods shall also be stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the reporting date.

- The restatement of financial statements in accordance with this Section requires the use of a general price index that reflects changes in general purchasing power. In most economies, there is a recognised general price index, normally produced by the government, that entities will follow.

Procedures for restating historical cost financial statements

Statement of Financial Position

- H2.5 Statement of Financial Position amounts not expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period are restated by applying a general price index.

- H2.6 Monetary items are not restated because they are expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Monetary items are money held and items to be received or paid in money.

- H2.7 Assets and liabilities linked by agreement to changes in prices, such as index-linked bonds and loans, are adjusted in accordance with the agreement and presented at this adjusted amount in the restated Statement of Financial Position.

- H2.8 All other assets and liabilities are non-monetary:

- (a) some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at the end of the reporting period, such as net realisable value and fair value, so they are not restated. All other non-monetary assets and liabilities are restated.

- (b) most non-monetary items are carried at cost or cost less depreciation; hence, they are expressed at amounts current at their date of acquisition. The restated cost, or cost less depreciation, of each item is determined by applying to its historical cost and accumulated depreciation the change in a general price index from the date of acquisition to the end of the reporting period.

- (c) some non-monetary items are carried at amounts current at dates other than that of acquisition or the reporting date – for example, property, plant and equipment that has been revalued at some earlier date. In these cases, the carrying amounts are restated from the date of the revaluation.

- (d) the restated amount of a non-monetary item is reduced in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets when it exceeds its recoverable amount.

- At the beginning of the first period of application of this Section, the components of net assets, except restricted funds and unrestricted funds (including any revaluation surplus), are restated by applying a general price index from the dates the components were contributed or otherwise arose. Any revaluation surplus that arose in previous periods is eliminated. Restated restricted funds and unrestricted funds are derived from all the other amounts in the restated Statement of Financial Position.

- H2.10 At the end of the first period and in subsequent periods, all components of equity claims are restated by applying a general price index from the beginning of the period or the date of contribution if later. The changes for the period in equity claims are disclosed in accordance with B4 Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

Statement of Income and Expenses and Statement of Changes in Net Assets

- All items in the Statement of Income and Expenses and Statement of Changes in Net Assets shall be expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Consequently, all amounts need to be restated by applying the change in the general price index from the dates when the items of income and expenses were initially recognised in the financial statements. If general inflation is approximately even throughout the period, and the items of income and expense arose approximately evenly throughout the period, an average rate of inflation may be appropriate.

Statement of Cash Flows

- H2.12 An NPO shall express all items in the Statement of Cash Flows in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period.

Gain or loss on net monetary position

- In a period of inflation, an NPO holding an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities loses purchasing power, and an NPO with an excess of monetary liabilities over monetary assets gains purchasing power, to the extent the assets and liabilities are not linked to a price level. An NPO shall include in surplus or deficit the gain or loss on the net monetary position. An NPO shall offset the adjustment to those assets and liabilities linked by agreement to changes in prices made in accordance with paragraph H2.7 against the gain or loss on net monetary position.

Economies ceasing to be hyperinflationary

- H2.14 When an economy ceases to be hyperinflationary and an NPO discontinues the preparation and presentation of financial statements prepared in accordance with this Section, it shall treat the amounts expressed in the presentation currency at the end of the previous reporting period as the basis for the carrying amounts in its subsequent financial statements.

Disclosures

- H2.15 An NPO to which this Section applies shall disclose the following:

- (a) the fact that financial statements and other prior period data have been restated for changes in the general purchasing power of the functional currency;

- (b) the identity and level of the price index at the reporting date and changes during the current reporting period and the previous reporting period; and

- (c) amount of gain or loss on monetary items.

H3 – Events after the end of the reporting period

Scope of this Section

- H3.1 This Section defines events after the end of the reporting period and sets out principles for recognising, measuring and disclosing those events.

Events after the end of the reporting period defined

- H3.2 Events after the end of the reporting period are those events, favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. There are two types of events:

- (a) those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period (adjusting events after the end of the reporting period); and

- (b) those that are indicative of conditions that arose after the end of the reporting period (non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period).

- H3.3 Events after the end of the reporting period include all events up to the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue, even if those events occur after the public announcement of surplus or deficit or other selected financial information.

Recognition and measurement

Adjusting events after the end of the reporting period

- H3.4 An NPO shall adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements, including related disclosures, to reflect adjusting events after the end of the reporting period.

- The following are examples of adjusting events after the end of the reporting period that require an NPO to adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements, or to recognise items that were not previously recognised:

- (a) the settlement after the end of the reporting period of a court case that confirms that the NPO had a present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The NPO adjusts any previously recognised provision related to this court case in accordance with D5 Provisions and contingencies or recognises a new provision. The NPO does not merely disclose a contingent liability. Instead the settlement provides additional evidence to be considered in determining the provision that should be recognised at the end of the reporting period in accordance with D5.

- (b) the receipt of information after the end of the reporting period indicating that an asset was impaired at the end of the reporting period or that the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that asset needs to be adjusted. For example:

- (i) the bankruptcy of a customer or grantor that occurs after the end of the reporting period usually confirms that a loss existed at the end of the reporting period on a receivable and that the NPO needs to adjust the carrying amount of the receivable; and

- (ii) the sale of inventories after the end of the reporting period may give evidence about their selling price at the end of the reporting period for the purpose of assessing impairment at that date.

- (c) the determination after the end of the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of the reporting period.

- (d) the determination after the end of the reporting period of the amount of bonus payments, if the NPO had a legal or constructive obligation at the end of the reporting period to make such payments as a result of events before that date (see D4 Employee benefits).

- (e) the discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial statements are incorrect.

Non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period

- H3.6 An NPO shall not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements to reflect non- adjusting events after the end of the reporting period.

- H3.7 Examples of non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period include:

- (a) a decline in market value of investments between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. The decline in market value does not normally relate to the condition of the investments at the end of the reporting period but reflects circumstances that have arisen subsequently. Consequently, an NPO does not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the investments. Similarly, the NPO does not update the amounts disclosed for the investments as at the end of the reporting period, although it may need to give additional disclosure in accordance with paragraph H3.10.

- (b) an amount that becomes receivable as a result of a favourable judgement or settlement of a court case after the reporting date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue. This would be a contingent asset at the reporting date (see paragraph D5.16) and disclosure may be required by paragraph D5.19. However, agreement on the amount of damages for a judgment that was reached before the reporting date but was not previously recognised because the amount could not be measured reliably may constitute an adjusting event.

- (c) significant new grant agreements concluded after the end of the reporting period. If an NPO enters into a significant new grant agreement after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, this event does not typically relate to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. As such, the NPO does not adjust the amounts recognised in its financial statements for the reporting period. However, because the grant agreement may have a significant impact on the NPO’s future financial performance or operations, disclosure of the nature and financial impact of the new grant agreement may be required in accordance with paragraph H3.10 to ensure users of the financial statements are informed of material events occurring after the reporting period.

Distributions

- If an NPO declares a distribution to holders of equity claims after the end of the reporting period, the NPO shall not recognise those distributions as a liability at the end of the reporting period. The amount of the distribution may be presented as a segregated component of restricted funds or unrestricted funds at the end of the reporting period.

Disclosure

Date of authorisation for issue

- H3.9 An NPO shall disclose the date when the financial statements were authorised for issue and who gave that authorisation. If others have the power to amend the financial statements after issue, the NPO shall disclose that fact.

Non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period

- H3.10 An NPO shall disclose the following for each category of non-adjusting event after the end of the reporting period:

- (a) the nature of the event; and

- (b) an estimate of its financial effect or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.

- H3.11 The following are examples of non-adjusting events after the end of the reporting period that would generally result in disclosure; the disclosures will reflect information that becomes known after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue:

- (a) a major business combination or disposal of a major controlled entity;

- (b) announcement of a plan to discontinue an operation;

- (c) major purchases of assets, disposals or plans to dispose of assets, or expropriation of major assets by government;

- (d) the destruction of a major production plant by a fire;

- (e) announcement or commencement of the implementation of a major restructuring;

- (f) issues or repurchases of an NPO’s debt or equity claims;

- (g) abnormally large changes in asset prices or foreign exchange rates;

- (h) changes in tax rates or tax laws enacted or announced that have a significant effect on current and deferred tax assets and liabilities;

- (i) entering into significant commitments or contingent liabilities – for example, by issuing significant guarantees;

- (j) commencement of major litigation arising solely out of events that occurred after the end of the reporting period; and

- (k) significant new grant agreements concluded after the end of the reporting period.

H4 – Supplementary information

Scope of this Section

- H4.1 This Section shall be applied by an NPO when it prepares and distributes one or more Supplementary statements in accordance with INPAS Practice Guide 1 – Harmonised grant reporting (INPAS Practice Guide 1) to discharge accountability to its stakeholders, including donors.

- When paragraph H4.1 applies, an NPO shall disclose whole-of-NPO supplementary information. Supplementary information is the information that will allow a whole-of-NPO Supplementary statement in the format prescribed by INPAS Practice Guide 1 to be produced. Such information will need to be disclosed even if is not otherwise to be presented elsewhere in the general purpose financial statements by this Standard.

- H4.3 For all other NPOs, this Section is optional. An NPO may adopt the requirements of this Section, including the publication of a whole-of-NPO Supplementary statement that conforms to the format prescribed in INPAS Practice Guide 1.

Reporting boundary

- H4.4 Supplementary information shall be prepared using the NPO reporting boundary required by paragraphs A2.48–A2.53 of this Standard.

Recognition and measurement of supplementary information

- H4.5 Supplementary information to be disclosed in accordance with this Section shall be produced using the relevant recognition and measurement principles of this Standard.

Disclosure of supplementary information

- H4.6 An NPO shall disclose the amounts for all the classes of income and expenses that are required by the prescribed format of the Supplementary statement in INPAS Practice Guide 1 where they are not disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements.

- H4.7 Each item of supplementary information may be disclosed individually or together so that the whole-of-NPO information follows the Supplementary statement format.

- H4.8 An NPO is encouraged but not required to produce the information together. When an NPO adopts this approach, the information shall be presented in accordance with the format prescribed in INPAS Practice Guide 1.

- An NPO is not required to repeat the disclosures already made elsewhere in the financial statements when meeting the requirements of this Section. When an NPO adopts this approach, it shall identify in each of the relevant disclosures made in accordance with other sections of this Standard the class of income and/or expenses from the Supplementary statement format to which that disclosure relates.

- H4.10 When an NPO separately presents support costs in a Supplementary statement produced in accordance with INPAS Practice Guide 1, it shall disclose its total support costs as supplementary information.

Basis of reporting the supplementary information disclosures

- H4.11 An NPO shall disclose supplementary information in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of this Standard. Supplementary information shall therefore be prepared and disclosed as follows:

- (a) total income shall be consistent with total income presented in the Statement of Income and Expenses;

- (b) total expenses shall be consistent with total expenses as presented in the Statement of Income and Expenses;

- (c) foreign exchange gains and losses shall be consistent either with the amounts presented separately in the Statement of Income and Expenses or the Statement of Changes in Net Assets or both;

- (d) transfers between funds shall sum to zero across the NPO; and

- (e) any other financial movements must equal other amounts presented in the Statement of Income and Expenses or amounts presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets that are not included in (a)–(c).

- H4.12 Supplementary information or a whole-of-NPO Supplementary statement shall be consistent with the total movement in funds. It shall therefore not disclose movements in any equity claims or any other components of net assets that are not part of funds.

- H4.13 Exceptionally, if an NPO produces supplementary information using INPAS Practice Guide 1 that has a reporting boundary that differs from the boundary required by paragraph H4.4 or has recognition and measurement principles that are not consistent with this Standard, it shall disclose:

- (a) the alternative reporting boundary or recognition and measurement principles used;

- (b) a quantitative and qualitative explanation of any of the differences for each of the items in paragraph H4.11(a)–H4.11(e);

- (c) why it has been necessary to depart from the reporting NPO boundary or the recognition and measurement principles prescribed by this Standard.

Inventory and capital costs

- H4.14 An NPO shall only provide a separate disclosure for the supplementary information for capital and inventory costs when it has chosen to use the optional section of the Supplementary statement that relates to inventory and capital costs.

- H4.15 When an NPO has used the inventory and capital costs section in its Supplementary statements in INPAS Practice Guide 1, it shall disclose the acquisition costs for inventory and capital items for the reporting period.

Group Z –

Z1 – Transition to INPAS

Scope of this Section

- This Section applies to a first-time adopter of this Standard, regardless of whether its previous accounting framework was IFRS or IPSAS-based accounting standards or another set of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) such as its national accounting standards or another framework such as the cash basis or the local income tax basis.

- Z1.2 An entity that has applied INPAS in a previous reporting period but whose most recent previous annual financial report did not contain an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with INPAS must either apply this Section or apply INPAS retrospectively in accordance with B7 Accounting policies, estimates and errors as if the NPO had never stopped applying INPAS. When such an NPO does not elect to apply this Section, it is still required to apply the disclosure requirements in paragraph Z1.15 in addition to the disclosure requirements in B7.

First-time adoption

- Z1.3 A first-time adopting NPO shall apply this Section in its first financial report that conforms to this Standard.

- An NPO’s first financial report that conforms to this Standard is the first annual financial report in which the NPO makes an explicit and unreserved statement in that financial report of compliance with INPAS. A financial report prepared in accordance with this Standard is an NPO’s first such financial report if, for example, the NPO:

- (a) did not present a financial report for previous periods;

- (b) presented its most recent previous financial statements under national requirements that are not consistent with this Standard in all respects; or

- (c) presented its most recent previous financial statements in conformity with full IFRS Accounting Standards, the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard or IPSAS Standards.

- Z1.5 An NPO that makes an explicit and unreserved statement of full compliance with INPAS in its financial report must meet all of the requirements of paragraphs Z1.7–Z1.8, providing both financial statements and a narrative report. As part of transitional arrangements, for the first two years following the date of transition to INPAS, an NPO may make an explicit and unreserved statement in its financial report of compliance with the INPAS requirements for the financial statements only. Exceptions are not permitted for investments in associates or beneficial interests in joint ventures held by the NPO.

- Z1.6 After two years, an NPO shall make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with all of the requirements of INPAS. If the full requirements are not met within the two years following the date of adoption of INPAS, the NPO shall explain that it has not met the full requirements of INPAS and is unable to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance. This shall be the case even if the financial statements comply with INPAS. In these circumstances, the NPO shall follow the requirements of Z1.2. It may also make the attestation permitted by Z1.20.

- Z1.7 Paragraph B1.6 defines a complete set of financial statements and A3 Narrative reporting describes the narrative reporting requirement.

- Paragraph B1.16 requires an NPO to disclose, in a complete set of financial statements, comparative information in respect of the previous comparable period for all monetary amounts presented in the financial statements, as well as specified comparative narrative and descriptive information that form the notes to the financial statements. An NPO may present comparative information in respect of more than one comparable prior period. Consequently, an NPO’s date of transition to INPAS is the beginning of the earliest period for which the NPO presents full comparative information in accordance with the financial statement requirements of this Standard in its first financial report.

Procedures for preparing financial statements at the date

- Z1.9 Except as provided in paragraphs Z1.11–Z1.13, an NPO shall, on its date of transition to INPAS (that is, the beginning of the earliest period presented):

- (a) recognise all assets and liabilities whose recognition is required by INPAS;

- (b) not recognise items as assets or liabilities if this Standard does not permit such recognition;

- (c) reclassify items that it recognised under its previous financial reporting framework as one type of asset, liability or component of equity but are a different type of asset, liability or component of net assets under this Standard;

- (d) apply this Standard in measuring all recognised assets and liabilities; and

- (e) apply this Standard in determining the split of accumulated funds, including the General Fund, between restricted funds and unrestricted funds. Prospectively, the General Fund is a fund without restrictions.

- The accounting policies that an NPO uses on adoption of this Standard may differ from those that it used for the same date using its previous financial reporting framework. The resulting adjustments arise from transactions, other events or conditions before the date of transition to this Standard. Consequently, an NPO shall recognise those adjustments directly in the General Fund (unless they relate to restricted funds or another category of net assets) at the date of transition to this Standard.

- On first-time adoption of this Standard, an NPO shall not retrospectively change the accounting that it followed under its previous financial reporting framework for any of the following transactions:

- (a) derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Financial assets and liabilities derecognised under an NPO’s previous accounting framework before the date of transition shall not be recognised upon adoption of INPAS. Conversely, for financial assets and liabilities that would have been derecognised under INPAS in a transaction that took place before the date of transition but that were not derecognised under an NPO’s previous accounting framework, an NPO may choose (i) to derecognise them on adoption of INPAS or (ii) to continue to recognise them until disposed of or settled.

- (b) hedge accounting. An NPO shall not change its hedge accounting before the date of transition to INPAS for hedging relationships that no longer exist at the date of transition. For hedging relationships that exist at the date of transition, the NPO shall follow the hedge accounting requirements of F1 Part II Other financial instrument issues, including the requirements for discontinuing hedge accounting for hedging relationships that do not meet the conditions of Part II of F1.

- (c) accounting estimates.

- (d) discontinued operations.

- (e) measuring non-controlling interests. The requirements of paragraph B3.8 to allocate surplus or deficit between non-controlling interest and equity claims shall be applied prospectively from the date of transition to INPAS (or from such earlier date as this Standard is applied to restate business combinations – see paragraph Z1.12(a)).

- (f) loans at below-market rate of interest. A first-time adopting NPO shall apply the requirements in F1 Financial instruments prospectively to loans existing at the date of transition to this Standard. Consequently, if a first-time adopting NPO did not under its previous GAAP recognise and measure a loan on a basis that is consistent with this Standard, it shall use its previous GAAP carrying amount of the loan at the date of transition to this Standard as the carrying amount of the loan at that date and shall not recognise the benefit of any loan at a below-market rate of interest as a grant.

- (g) completed contracts with customers. An NPO shall not restate contracts that were completed before the date of transition to INPAS. A completed contract is a contract for which the NPO has transferred all of the goods or services identified in accordance with its previous GAAP.

- (h) grant agreements. An NPO shall not restate grant agreements that were completed before the date of transition to INPAS or were due to be completed within 12 months of the transition date. A completed grant agreement is where the NPO has completed all delivery obligations (that is, met the requirements in relation to the specified outcomes, activities or use of resources) or, where there are no delivery obligations, or has used all of the resources provided.

- An NPO may use one or more of the following exemptions in preparing its first financial statements that conform to this Standard:

- (a) business combinations. A first-time adopting NPO may elect not to apply G4 Business combinations and goodwill to business combinations that were effected before the date of transition to this Standard. However, if a first-time adopter restates any business combination to comply with G4, it shall restate all later business combinations.

- (b) fair value as deemed cost. A first-time adopter may elect to measure an item of property, plant and equipment (including heritage assets), an investment property, an intangible asset, financial asset (including endowments) or inventory on the date of transition to this Standard at its fair value and use that fair value as its deemed cost at that date.

- (c) revaluation as deemed cost. A first-time adopter may elect to use a previous GAAP revaluation of an item of property, plant and equipment (including heritage assets), an investment property, an intangible asset or inventory at or before the date of transition to this Standard as its deemed cost at the revaluation date.

- (d) event-driven fair value measurement as deemed cost. A first-time adopter may have established a deemed cost in accordance with its previous GAAP for some or all of its assets and liabilities by measuring them at their fair value at one particular date because of an event – for example, a valuation of the business, or parts of the business, for the purposes of a planned sale. If the measurement date:

- (i) is at or before the date of transition to this Standard, the NPO may use such event- driven fair value measurements as deemed cost at the date of that measurement.

- (ii) is after the date of transition to this Standard but during the periods covered by the first financial statements that conform to this Standard, the event-driven fair value measurements may be used as deemed cost when the event occurs. An NPO shall recognise the resulting adjustments directly in funds without restrictions (or if appropriate another category of net assets) at the measurement date. At the date of transition to this Standard, the NPO shall either establish the deemed cost by

applying the criteria in paragraph Z1.12(b)–(c) or measure those assets and liabilities in accordance with the other requirements in this Section.

- (e) cumulative translation differences. A5 Foreign currency translation requires an NPO to classify some translation differences as a separate component of net assets. A first- time adopter may elect to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to INPAS (a ‘fresh start’).

- separate financial statements. When an NPO prepares separate financial statements, paragraph G1.47 requires it to account for its beneficial interests in controlled entities, associates and jointly controlled entities either:

- (i) at cost less impairment;

- (ii) at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in surplus or deficit; or

- (iii) using the equity method following the procedures in paragraph G2.8.

If a first-time adopter measures such a beneficial interest at cost, it shall measure that beneficial interest at one of the following amounts at the date of transition:

- (iv) cost determined in accordance with G1 Consolidated and separate financial statements; or

- (v) deemed cost, which shall be either fair value at the date of transition to INPAS or previous GAAP carrying amount on that date.

- (g) compound financial instruments. Paragraph F2.13 requires an NPO to split a compound financial instrument into its liability and components due to equity claims at the date of issue. A first-time adopter need not separate those two components if the liability component is not outstanding at the date of transition to this Standard.

- (h) deferred income tax. A first-time adopter may apply D8 Income tax prospectively from the date of transition to INPAS, while applying the exception in paragraph D8.4 retrospectively.

- (i) service concession arrangements. A first-time adopter is not required to apply paragraphs E6.21–E6.25 to service concession arrangements entered into before the date of transition to this Standard.

- (j) extractive activities. A first-time adopter using full cost accounting under previous GAAP may elect to measure oil and gas assets (those used in the exploration, evaluation, development or production of oil and gas) on the date of transition to INPAS at the amount determined under the NPO’s previous GAAP. The NPO shall test those assets for impairment at the date of transition to this Standard in accordance with E5 Impairment of assets.

- (k) arrangements containing a lease. A first-time adopter may elect to determine whether an arrangement existing at the date of transition to INPAS contains a lease (see paragraph D6.3) on the basis of facts and circumstances existing at that date, instead of when the arrangement was entered into.

- (l) decommissioning liabilities included in the cost of property, plant and equipment. Paragraph E2.11(c) states that the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an NPO incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period. A first-time adopter may elect to measure this component of the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to INPAS, instead of on the date(s) when the obligation initially arose.

- (m) operations subject to rate regulation. If a first-time adopter holds items of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets that are used, or were previously used, in operations subject to rate regulation (that is, to provide goods or services to customers at prices/ rates established by an authorised body), it may elect to use the previous GAAP carrying amount of those items at the date of transition to this Standard as their deemed cost. If an NPO applies this exemption to an item, it need not apply it to all items. The NPO shall test those assets for impairment at the date of transition to this Standard in accordance with E5.

- (n) severe hyperinflation. If a first-time adopter has a functional currency that was subject to severe hyperinflation:

- (i) if its date of transition to this Standard is on or after the functional currency normalisation date, the NPO may elect to measure all assets and liabilities held before the functional currency normalisation date at fair value on the date of transition to this Standard and use that fair value as the deemed cost of those assets and liabilities at that date; and

- (ii) if the functional currency normalisation date falls within a 12-month comparative period, an entity may use a comparative period of less than 12 months, provided that a complete set of financial statements (as required by paragraph B1.6) is provided for that shorter period.

- If it is impracticable for an NPO to make one or more of the adjustments required by paragraph Z1.9 at the date of transition, the entity shall apply paragraphs Z1.9– Z1.12 for such adjustments in the earliest period for which it is practicable to do so and shall identify which amounts in the financial statements have not been restated. If it is impracticable for an NPO to provide any of the disclosures required by this Standard, including those for comparative periods, the omission shall be disclosed.

Disclosures

Explanation of transition to INPAS

- Z1.14 An NPO shall explain how the transition from its previous financial reporting framework to this Standard affected its reported financial position, financial performance and cash flows.

- Z1.15 An NPO that has applied INPAS in a previous period, as described in paragraph Z1.2, shall disclose:

- (a) the reason it stopped applying INPAS or was unable to meet the full requirements of INPAS;

- (b) the reason it is resuming the application of INPAS; and

- (c) whether it has applied this Section or has applied INPAS retrospectively in accordance with B7.

Reconciliation

- Z1.16 To comply with paragraph Z1.14, an NPO’s first financial report prepared using this Standard shall include:

- (a) a description of the nature of each change in accounting policy;

- (b) reconciliations of its net assets determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework to its net assets determined in accordance with this Standard for both of the following dates:

- (i) the date of transition to this Standard; and

- (ii) the end of the latest period presented in the NPO’s most recent annual financial statements determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework.

- (c) a reconciliation of the surplus or deficit determined in accordance with its previous financial reporting framework for the latest period in the NPO’s most recent annual financial statements to its surplus or deficit determined in accordance with this Standard for the same period.

- Z1.17 If an NPO becomes aware of errors made under its previous financial reporting framework, the reconciliations required by paragraph Z1.16(b) and Z1.16(c) shall, to the extent practicable, distinguish the correction of those errors from changes in accounting policies.

- Z1.18 If an NPO did not present financial statements for previous periods, it shall disclose that fact in its first financial statements that conform to this Standard.

- Z1.19 An NPO must meet the minimum narrative reporting requirements set out in A3 to make an explicit and unreserved statement of compliance with INPAS narrative reporting. Information in respect of the previous comparable period for amounts and descriptive information that forms the narrative report shall be provided. An NPO may present comparative information in respect of more than one comparable prior period. If it is impracticable for an NPO to provide comparative information due to undue cost or effort, the omission shall be disclosed.

- Z1.20 An NPO that is not able to express compliance with the full requirements of INPAS shall include an attestation that is it working towards compliance with INPAS. The attestation shall include the sections of INPAS yet to be fully implemented.

Section 26 Share-based payments is not part of INPAS, as it does not include requirements relevant to

General/explanation

There are a number of alignment changes that apply across all INPAS sections. These are not listed individually. These changes relate to:

- • terminology – INPAS uses different terminology, for example, by referring specifically to NPOs rather than entities more generally. The main terminology changes are listed below.

| INPAS | Third edition of the /FRS for SMEs Accounting Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Surplus or deficit | Profit or loss |
| Controlled entity | Subsidiary |
| Controlling NPO | Parent |
| Beneficial interest | Investment |
| Net assets | Equity (financial statement element) |
| Equity claims | Equity (investor interest in an entity) |
| Operating unit | Cash-generating unit |
| Distributions arising from equity claims | Dividends |


- • financial statements – changes have been made to two of the four primary financial statements (see B3 Statement of Income and Expenses and B4 Statement of Changes in Net Assets below). These changes have been reflected in other INPAS sections so that they align with INPAS financial statements.

- • referencing – the structure of INPAS does not follow the structure of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard to make the material more accessible to NPOs, particularly where new material has been developed. References have been updated to refer to the location of guidance in INPAS or exceptionally to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The equivalent section in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard is given in backets in the explanation of differences below.

The following text provides an explanation of other key changes where relevant.

P1 – Preface

- • INPAS’s Preface provides a description of the history of the IFR4NPO project, the objectives of INPAS and a summary of the governance arrangements associated with its approval.

- • INPAS’s Preface describes general purpose financial reports as well as the objectives of general purpose financial statements in an NPO-specific context.

- • INPAS’s Preface explains the use of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard as its foundational framework. It also explains how INPAS uses full IFRS Accounting Standards, IPSAS, their broader conceptual frameworks and jurisdictional-level standards where the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard does not meet the needs of NPOs. It provides a hierarchy on their use.

- • INPAS’s Preface notes that it has been developed to apply to the general purpose financial reports and general purpose financial statements of NPOs whose broad characteristics are described in A1 NPOs rather than small and medium-sized entities as defined in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- • INPAS’s Preface also explains that INPAS does not yet address all NPO-specific issues. The remaining NPO-specific issues will be addressed in subsequent editions of INPAS.

Principles

A1 – NPOs (Section 1)

- • INPAS A1 explains that it is intended for use by NPOs and that a broad characteristics approach has been used to identify the entities that are intended to be within the scope of INPAS.

- • INPAS A1 notes that the decision on which entities are required or permitted to use INPAS rests with the relevant authorities in individual jurisdictions.

- • INPAS A1 notes that for the purposes of INPAS, an NPO is an entity that publishes general purpose financial reports for external users and has two broad characteristics. It also confirms that INPAS is not developed for use by government and public sector entities.

- • INPAS A1 explains that entities that have public accountability as defined in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard may find INPAS useful, but it is unlikely to meet the needs of users of their general purpose financial reports. If such entities use INPAS, they are required to disclose this and explain why INPAS meets the needs of users.

A2 – Concepts and pervasive principles (Section 2)

- • A2 provides a description of the primary users of NPO general purpose financial reports, their information needs for accountability and decision-making purposes and how the information provided by general purpose financial reports meets the needs of users.

- • A2 describes the reporting NPO and provides additional guidance on how to determine the reporting NPO and its reporting boundary.

- • A2 introduces the concept of service potential in the definition of elements, where service potential relates to the capacity to provide services that contribute to achieving the NPO’s objectives without necessarily generating net cash inflows.

- • The concept of ownership implied from equity in the private sector does not apply to non- profit organisations that operate for the benefit of service beneficiaries rather than for private distributions.

- • Financial interests in the net assets held by private individuals are instead defined as equity claims. Equity claims are a subset of net assets, as given the characteristics of an NPO, equity claims are not expected to be the most significant claim on an NPO’s net assets.

- • Net assets are defined as the residual of recognised assets minus recognised liabilities available to the NPO to achieve its objectives.

- • A2 amends the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard’s recognition process for income and expenses to reflect that some income and expenses contribute to surplus and deficit, and some are instead recognised in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

- • A2 includes some presentation principles from IPSAS in relation to decisions on the selection, location and organisation of information in response to users’ information needs.

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

A4 – Fair value measurement (Section 12)

- • The IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard does not specifically consider when fair value is used to determine the deemed cost of a donated asset on initial recognition. Although the existing guidance can be applied to such assets, additional application guidance has been developed to assist an NPO with donated assets.

- • The illustrative examples in this Section have been expanded to include donated assets, and the illustrative examples are included in the Implementation Guidance.

A5 – Foreign currency translation (Section 30)

- • The factors for determining the functional currency for the NPO and its foreign operations have been broadened from the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard to include grants and donations.

- • Similarly, the types of foreign currency transactions that might be relevant have been broadened to include grant revenue and expenses from grant agreements.

- • INPAS A5 requires exchange rate gains and losses on monetary items to be presented in the financial statements and in the accompanying notes in accordance with the transaction to which it relates.

- • INPAS A5 has replaced ‘component of equity’ with ‘net assets’ in describing where exchange gains and losses should be disclosed.

- • B1 has been broadened where relevant to consider the presentation and compliance requirements of the narrative report that is within the scope of INPAS as well as the financial statements. As a consequence, the title of the section and some headings have been amended.

- • INPAS B1 refers to income and expenses rather than financial performance to better represent the nature of an NPO. While financial performance is important to all organisations, the purposes/mission of an NPO may prioritise other factors in assessing overall performance.

- • INPAS B1 requires an NPO to produce a Statement of Income and Expenses that results in a surplus or deficit rather than allowing the choice available in Section 3 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard of either a single statement of comprehensive income or a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income. Surplus and deficit replace profit and loss.

- • INPAS B1 replaces the statement of changes in equity with a Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

- • The additional guidance in Section 3 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard that relates to the required use of its statements has been removed where these statements are not required in INPAS.

- • INPAS B1 includes additional commentary in relation to the transitional guidance, which is contained in INPAS Z1 Transition to INPAS.

- • INPAS B1 amends the information required about the reporting entity, including registration information, so that it addresses the more varied arrangements for NPOs. The requirements are intended to provide equivalent information.

- • INPAS allows alternative headings and descriptions to be used in addition to alternative titles to financial statements where this would not result in information that is misleading. This is to provide explicit flexibility for NPOs.

B2 – Statement of Financial Position (Section 4)

- • INPAS B2 replaces ‘equity’ as defined in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard with ‘net assets’ in its description of the Statement of Financial Position. Net assets are comprised of restricted funds, unrestricted funds and equity claims (which are defined in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles for the NPO context) and exceptionally non-controlling interests.

- • Consequently, INPAS B2 removes ‘equity attributable to owners of the entity’ and replaces it with equity claims, restricted funds and unrestricted funds. Several core disclosures relating to equity have been removed, with disclosures only where applicable.

- • INPAS B2 requires that restricted funds and unrestricted funds are disaggregated into their main components, either on the face of or in the notes to the financial statements, but there is no requirement to split all items in the Statement of Financial Position between those with and without restrictions.

- • INPAS B2 replaces the word ‘trade’ in relation to receivables, payables and liabilities used in Section 4 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard with ‘operating’ to accommodate the range of activities that NPOs carry out.

B3 – Statement of Income and Expenses (Section 5)

- • INPAS B3 requires an NPO to produce a Statement of Income and Expenses that results in a surplus or deficit rather than allowing the choice available in Section 5 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard of either a single statement of comprehensive income or a separate income statement and statement of comprehensive income. References to the choice between these two statements have been removed throughout B3.

- • The terms surplus and deficit are used in INPAS B3 rather than profit and loss.

- • INPAS B3 requires that unrealised gains and losses arising from certain fair value adjustments are presented after surplus or deficit from operating activities on the Statement of Income and Expenses unless required to be presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

- • INPAS B3 refers to holders of equity claims instead of ‘owners of the parent’ used in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- • The requirements relating to the classification of expenses are not included in B3, as a separate Section provides NPO-specific guidance for the approach to the analysis.

- • INPAS B4 replaces the statement of changes in equity with a Statement of Changes in Net Assets and does not include any requirements for a statement of income and retained earnings.

- • INPAS B4 amends the scope from requiring the presentation of changes in an entity’s equity for a period to changes in an NPO’s net assets, with the purpose amended to reflect the single statement approach.

- • INPAS B4 prescribes the items to be presented on the face of the statement to allow the subtotalling of income and expenses consistent with the definition of comprehensive income.

- • INPAS B4 requires a reconciliation of the opening and closing carrying amounts of any material subcomponent of net assets, restricted funds, unrestricted funds and non-controlling interests in the notes to the accounts.

- • INPAS B4 clarifies that items reclassified to surplus or deficit when specific conditions are met as required by F1 Financial instruments are grouped separately.

B5 – Statement of Cash Flows (Section 7)

- • INPAS B5 requires the disclosure of information that is more typical of an NPO, including cash receipts from grants and donations as part of operating cash flows and cash and cash equivalents not available for use by the NPO including restrictions by funders.

- • INPAS B5 clarifies that loans and the repayment of loans as part of NPOs’ programmes for service beneficiaries should be treated as operating cash flows.

- • INPAS B5 replaces references to the two statements that capture all income and expenses with the Statement of Income and Expenses.

B6 – Notes to the financial statements (Section 8)

- • References to the choice of two statements for financial performance have been replaced with the single Statement of Income and Expenses required by INPAS.

B7 – Accounting policies, estimates and errors (Section 10)

- • Additional guidance is provided in INPAS B7 in case an NPO has a transaction, event or condition not covered in other sections of INPAS. The guidance specifies alternative authoritative sources and circumstances that should be considered where appropriate.

B8 – Fund accounting (New)

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

C1 – Revenue (New and Section 23)

Part I – New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

Part II – based on the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- • The scope section has been relocated to the preface, as the scope applies to both Part I and Part II.

- • The overview of the 5-step revenue recognition model is included in the preface to C1, as the 5-step model is being used to recognise delivery obligations in grant agreements that have characteristics in common to promises in contracts with customers.

- • The accounting for principal-agent arrangements is included in the preface to C1, as it shares principles in common with revenue from grants and donations.

- • Section 24 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard (government grants) is not included in INPAS, as government grants are covered by INPAS C1 Part I, which covers a wider range of non-exchange revenue. The recognition and measurement principles are included in the preface to C1.

Expenses and liabilities

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

D2 – Expenses on grants and donations (New)

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

D3 – Fundraising costs (New)

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

D4 – Employee benefits (Section 28)

- • The references to share-based payments have been removed from this Section, as the full guidance on share-based payments is not included in INPAS. Share-based employee remuneration is not expected to be a feature of NPOs.

- • References to profit-sharing arrangements have been removed from this Section. Given the characteristics of an NPO, it is not expected that profit sharing will exist.

- • The requirement that actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income is presented in the statement of comprehensive income has been removed, as this statement is not a primary statement in INPAS.

- • A new disclosure has been added requiring information about short-term employee benefits. This covers the major categories of employee expenses including salaries, wages, taxes and national insurance, as well as bonuses and non-cash benefits and other staff-related statutory or contractual costs.

D5 – Provisions and contingencies (Section 21)

- • The reference to ‘obligations arising as a result of a past event’ has been updated to ‘obligations arising as a result of past events’ in line with the concepts and pervasive principles.

- • The examples provided in Section 21 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard have been relocated to the INPAS Implementation Guidance. A new example relating to an onerous grant agreement has been added.

- • No changes other than terminology have been made.

D7 – Borrowing costs (Section 25)

- • No changes other than terminology have been made.

D8 – Income tax (Section 29)

- • C1 Part I Revenue from grants and donations has superseded Section 24 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. C1 Part I uses the principles of the 5-step model used for other revenue recognition. The exclusion for timing differences relating to government grants has been replaced by reference to C1 Part I.

- • INPAS requires that the tax expense is recognised in the same component as the transaction or other event that resulted in the tax expense rather than requiring recognition in total comprehensive income.

Non-financial assets

E1 – Inventories (Section 13)

- • INPAS E1 broadens the scope of this Section to include inventory held for distribution and fundraising and specifically inventory held for distribution to service recipients in the course of an NPO’s ordinary operations. Additional measurement requirements are included for these types of inventories.

- • The exclusion of commodity brokers and dealers that measure their inventories at fair value less costs to sell through profit and loss has been removed, as these activities are expected to not be relevant to an NPO.

- • INPAS E1 includes a requirement that inventory received for no or nominal cost is to be measured at fair value (subject to permitted exceptions).

- • INPAS E1 includes permitted exceptions that allow certain types of donated inventory to not be recognised until it is sold or transferred to another party in the course of fundraising activities, or to not be recognised until it has been distributed to service recipients. These permitted exceptions provide pragmatic relief for an NPO in recognising and measuring these kinds of inventories. INPAS E1 requires that use of the permitted exceptions be disclosed.

- • INPAS E1 sets the expectation that all donated inventories can be reliably measured, providing additional guidance, and requires additional disclosure if inventories have not been recognised because a reliable measurement cannot be obtained.

- • Additional application guidance has been developed for E1 that further explains the main amendments from Section 13 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and cross-refers to A4 Fair value measurement, where there is new Application Guidance relating to the fair value measurement of donations in kind, including donated inventory.

- • Additional text has been added to make clear that assets sharing characteristics with an investment property but primarily used for service delivery are to be treated in accordance with E2.

- • A paragraph has been added to the guidance for property, plant and equipment for assets that have been donated, clarifying that fair value is to be used on initial recognition.

- • A new disclosure has been added as a consequence of fund accounting requirements that is focused on activities where the use of resources is restricted. E2.37(d) requires an NPO to disclose the gross book value, accumulated depreciation and net book value of property, plant and equipment whose use is restricted by donors or grantors to specified activities.

E3 – Investment property (Section 16)

- • E3 includes an additional paragraph to distinguish between purchased and donated investment property. The new paragraph addresses the measurement of the investment property on receipt to provide clarity about the measurement base. It requires a donated investment property to be measured at fair value in accordance with A4 Fair value measurement on initial recognition.

- • INPAS clarifies that assets that might otherwise be considered investment property but are held for an NPO’s missional objectives (for example, social housing) shall not be classed as investment property but instead as property, plant and equipment. Such assets should follow the requirements of E2 Property, plant and equipment.

E4 – Intangible assets other than goodwill (Section 18)

- • Consistent with E3 Investment property and E2 Property, plant and equipment, a paragraph has been added to this Section to provide guidance on determining the deemed cost of donated assets, where donated assets are valued at fair value on initial recognition.

E5 – Impairment of assets (Section 27)

- • The scope of inventory in E1 Inventories has been broadened to include inventory held for distribution and specifically inventory held for distribution to service recipients at no or nominal consideration. Additional measurement requirements were included for these types of inventories. As a consequence, a method of assessing the impairment of this type of inventory was added. Inventory held for distribution at no or nominal consideration is valued at the cost adjusted for any loss of service potential (adjusted cost).

- • The term ‘cash-generating unit’ is used in Section 27 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. Many NPOs hold assets to deliver their missional objectives rather than to generate cash flows. As a consequence, the term ‘cash-generating unit’ has been broadened to include all activities and termed ‘operating unit’.

- • The description of ‘value in use’ used in Section 27 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard has been broadened to include ‘other economic benefits’ and ‘service potential’. This is consistent with the description of value in use in INPAS A2 Concepts and pervasive principles.

- • With the inclusion of ‘other economic benefits’ and ‘service potential’ in the description of ‘value in use’, an additional step has been added into the calculation of present value. An NPO is required to estimate future other economic benefit and service potential in carrying out such calculations.

E6 – Specialised activities (Section 34)

- • No changes other than terminology have been made.

Financial assets and liabilities

F1 – Financial instruments (Section 11)

- • Any references to share-based payments have been removed, as the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard section on share-based payments is not included in INPAS.

- • The examples provided in Section 11 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard have been relocated to the INPAS Implementation Guidance. Examples of monetary assets and liabilities arising from grant agreements have been added.

F2 – Liabilities and equity claims (Section 22)

- • The concept of ownership implied from equity in for-profit entities does not apply to non- profit organisations that operate for the benefit of service beneficiaries rather than for private distributions. The definition of equity has been amended in A2 Concepts and pervasive principles and as a consequence references to equity have been replaced by equity claims.

- • References to share-based payments have been removed, as Section 26 of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard on share-based payments is not included in INPAS.

- • The paragraphs relating to the sale of options, rights and warrants, extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments and treasury shares have been removed, as they are not considered relevant to NPOs.

- • Additional text has been added to clarify that an instrument shall be classified as a liability if the instrument can only be redeemed at par or at an amount index-linked to the amount originally paid. This is because in substance the holder of the equity claim does not have a financial interest in the net assets of the NPO.

- • Amendments have been made to the guidance on puttable instruments to reflect the definition of equity claims used in INPAS and the expectation that future cash flows from a puttable instrument will not be a feature of equity claims for NPOs.

G1 – Consolidated and separate financial statements (Section 9)

- • INPAS G1 is designed to produce consolidated financial statements that follow the format set out in INPAS B1–B5, using the terminology developed in those sections and reflecting the wider scope of the reporting NPO set out in INPAS A2 Concepts and pervasive principles.

- • INPAS G1 uses the term ‘controlling NPO’ rather than ‘parent’, ‘controlled entity’ rather than ‘subsidiary’ and ‘beneficial interest’ instead of (certain uses of) ‘investment’, to better represent the nature of relationships between NPOs and other group entities.

- • INPAS G1 contains additional material on the basis of control, which determines which entities should be consolidated, having regard to the different governance arrangements and other mechanisms through which power may be exercised and the wider nature of return, encompassing the wider purposes of NPOs working for the benefit of the public.

- • INPAS G1 references international financial reporting frameworks and national GAAP rather than referencing only full IFRS Accounting Standards, reflecting the fact that consolidations under INPAS may involve entities reporting under other frameworks.

- • INPAS G1 sets out guidance on adjustments that may need to be made when consolidating controlled entities reporting under full IFRS Accounting Standards, reframing material expressed by reference to other comprehensive expenditure that is not reflected in INPAS.

- • INPAS G1 sets out specific guidance on consolidation procedures for restricted and unrestricted funds.

G2 – Investment in associates (Section 14)

- • No changes other than terminology have been made.

G3 – Joint arrangements (Section 15)

- • INPAS paragraphs G3.17 and G3.18 have been amended to reflect the requirements for the NPO only where the NPO is a party to a joint arrangement with another party.

G4 – Business combinations and goodwill (Section 19)

- • The concept of ‘business’ may not resonate with NPOs and minor amendments have been made to the text to include circumstances more relevant to an NPO. This includes additional examples of control, the purpose of the organisation and to make clear that the section applies to all NPOs.

- • A simplification has been added for the combination of two NPOs that both have positive net assets. The requirement to follow the additional procedures in paragraph G4.25 have been removed.

- • Alignments have also been made to other sections in removing references to share price and equity where these are not relevant to NPOs.

Restatements and additional information

H1 – Related party disclosures (Section 33)

- • The description of related parties has been broadened to specifically include members of a reporting NPO’s governing body (paid or not) who provide oversight of the NPO’s activities.

- • The scope of possible related party transactions has been widened in H1.3 to include an assessment of the characteristics of an NPO’s governance arrangements, as these can take a variety of forms.

- • INPAS H1 requires that the NPO shall disclose details of the personnel compensation paid to governing board members (if any) and the legal basis of those payments. There is also a requirement to disclose the nature and amount of all out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed.

- • Where a governing body member receives services in accordance with an NPO’s primary purpose and that are provided on the same terms as any other eligible individual or entity, the transactions do not need to be disclosed.

- • Similarly, services received in accordance with an NPO’s primary purpose and that are provided on the same terms as any other eligible individual or entity do not need to be disclosed.

- • The reference to ‘director’ has been removed from H1.4, as members of an NPO’s governing body are scoped into key management personnel in H1.6. The type of relationships that might not be a related party relationship has been widened to include grant providers.

- • The wording in H1.2 and H1.16 has been slightly amended to use NPO-specific terminology. In H1.16, the words ‘parent and subsidiary’ have been removed in the context of participation in shared benefit plans, as this is clear in the description of the entities that participate in the sharing of risks.

- • The disclosures in H1.15(a) have been broadened from only entities to also include individuals with control, joint control or significant influence, reflecting the broader nature of those who might hold equity claims.

H2 – Hyperinflation (Section 31)

- • Reference to the statement of comprehensive income and income statement have been replaced by the Statement of Income and Expenses and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.

H3 – Events after the reporting period (Section 32)

- • References to profit sharing have been removed, as they are not expected to be a feature of NPO remuneration arrangements.

- • References to ‘trade receivables’ have been changed to ‘receivables’ as the primary objective of NPO is not expected to be ‘trade’.

- • A specific reference to the ‘entity’s owners’ as having the power to amend the financial statements after issue has been removed.

- • New grant arrangements concluded after the end of the reporting period has been added as another example of a non-adjusting post balance sheet event.

- • New INPAS Section with no equivalent in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.

- • The requirement for narrative reporting as part of the first-time adoption requirements has been added. To provide clarity, the text differentiates between narrative information that can form part of the notes to the financial statements from the narrative report.

- • INPAS requires minimum narrative reporting information as well as the financial statements. Compliance with INPAS therefore requires compliance with the narrative reporting requirements in addition to the financial statements. To aid the transition, INPAS allows an NPO to produce a compliance statement for the financial statements only for the first two years. After this period, an NPO will not be eligible to express compliance with INPAS until it produces the narrative reporting information.

- • The ability to use fair value as deemed cost on first-time adoption has been expanded to include financial assets such as endowments as well as inventories. The text clarifies that heritage assets can also be measured at fair value on first-time adoption.

- • INPAS requires that accumulated funds are split between restricted funds and unrestricted funds. This requirement has been added to the information that is required on first-time adoption.

- • Amendments have been made to the list of transactions that do not require the retrospective application of INPAS. A change has been made to the text regarding government loans to expand it to include all loans below-market rate of interest. A new set of transactions have been added for grant agreements. Where a grant agreement has been completed or it is due

to be completed within no more than 12 months of the transition date, a retrospective change is not required.

- • The exemption related to shared-based payments has been deleted. Share-based payments are not proposed to be included in INPAS and references elsewhere have also been deleted.

Annex B – INPAS and other accounting

The development of two new INPAS sections were informed by International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). This appendix set out how these Standards have informed the development of INPAS.

| INPAS Section |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Revenue from grants and donations | IPSAS 47 Revenue |
|  | Grant expenses | IPSAS 48 Transfer Expenses |


As with other INPAS sections, the terminology used is specific to NPOs and is consistent with other INPAS sections.

C1 Part I – Revenue from grants and donations

C1 comprises two parts, with a preface that explains the structure of the section and contains content that is common to both parts. Part II is based on the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. Part I is new material for NPOs that has been informed by IPSAS 47 Revenue. The main differences to IPSAS 47 are as follows:

- • INPAS C1 Part I does not draw on ‘binding arrangements’ that exist in IPSAS 47 (binding arrangement). This is because INPAS C1 Part I is focused only on grants and donations, and this part of C1 specifically excludes contracts with customers.

- • INPAS C1 Part I uses the term ‘delivery obligation’, which is similar to a ‘compliance obligation’ in IPSAS 47, except that it does not apply to requirements to transfer goods or services to a customer. The definition of a ‘delivery obligation’ specifically mentions outcomes and activities, whereas the definition of a ‘compliance obligation’ in IPSAS 47 is more focused on goods and services.

- • INPAS C1 Part I includes permitted exceptions for the recognition of revenue from gifts in kind. It allows certain types of donated inventory to not be recognised until it is sold, used or distributed to service recipients. These permitted exceptions provide pragmatic relief for an NPO in recognising and measuring these kinds of inventories.

- • INPAS C1 Part I requires services in kind that are critical to an NPO’s mission to be recognised. This is not a requirement of IPSAS 47.

- • The disclosure requirements in INPAS C1 Part I are reduced from those in IPSAS 47. The disclosure requirements included in C1 Part I are based on those in the third edition of the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. These have been adapted for the NPO context and specifically the inclusion of grants. Additional disclosures have been included where there is no equivalent requirement in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard – for example, for grant agreements where there is no ‘delivery obligation’.

D2 – Expenses on grants and donations

D2 is new material for NPOs that has been informed by IPSAS 48 Transfer Expenses. The main conceptual differences to IPSAS 48 are as follows:

- • D2 uses terminology specific to NPOs, referring to grants rather than transfers.

- • INPAS D2 uses the terms ‘grant agreements with fulfilment rights’ and ‘delivery obligations’ rather than ‘binding arrangement’ and ‘compliance obligations’. These permit the concept of a grant recipient undertaking to meet obligations within the grant agreement rather than a promise, as used in IPSAS 48, and also the possibility that its obligations can be to deliver a specific outcome or activity in addition to using resources for distinct services, goods and other assets.

- • Guidance on the enforceability of a grant agreement has been adapted for the non-profit sector, including the addition of content, customary practices and general statements of intent. More detailed guidance on enforceability is included in C1.

- INPAS D2 includes guidance on principal versus agent considerations.

- • The disclosure requirements in INPAS D2 have been adapted to the nature of NPOs and grant agreements.

Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.

The result of applying a measurement basis to an asset or liability and related
